      <abstract>
        <p>Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a subtype of lung cancer with poor prognosis. Expression array analysis of 23 SCLC cases and 42 normal tissues revealed that <italic>EZH2</italic> and other PRC2 members were highly expressed in SCLC. ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 suggested that genes with H3K27me3(+) in SCLC were extended not only to PRC2-target genes in ES cells but also to other target genes such as cellular adhesion-related genes. These H3K27me3(+) genes in SCLC were repressed significantly, and introduction of the most repressed gene <italic>JUB</italic> into SCLC cell line lead to growth inhibition. Shorter overall survival of clinical SCLC cases correlated to repression of <italic>JUB</italic> alone, or a set of four genes including H3K27me3(+) genes. Treatment with EZH2 inhibitors, DZNep and GSK126, resulted in growth repression of SCLC cell lines. High PRC2 expression was suggested to contribute to gene repression in SCLC, and may play a role in genesis of SCLC.</p>

  <body>
    <p>Lung cancer is the most leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world, accounting for about 1.4 million deaths each year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>. Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a histologic subtype of lung cancer with a distinct clinical and biological feature, and represents approximately 15% of all the lung cancer cases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>. SCLC is strongly related to cigarette smoking, and approximately 90% of cases are reported to be smokers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. The prognosis is poor mainly due to early dissemination and rapid growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>. While SCLC shows high response to initial therapy, most cases relapse and become refractory to treatment. The 5-year survival is as poor as 15–25% for cases at limited stage, and &lt;1% for cases at extensive stage<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>.</p>
    <p>Frequent mutation of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> is reported in SCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. Sutherland <italic>et al.</italic> reported that cell type-restricted inactivation of <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Rb1</italic> in mouse lung neuroendocrine cells and alveolar type 2 cells induced formation of lung tumors with extrapulmonary metastasis resembling SCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. Whole genome sequencing of SCLC cell line NCI-H209 revealed &gt;20,000 somatic substitutions including 134 of those in coding exons, and rearrangement of <italic>CHD7</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>. Rudin <italic>et al</italic>. analyzed exome, transcriptome and copy number aberration of clinical SCLC samples, normal tissues, SCLC cell lines and normal cell lines, and identified 22 significantly mutated cancer-associated genes in SCLC, including <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>. Furthermore they found <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification and <italic>RLF-MYCL1</italic> fusion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>. Peifer <italic>et al.</italic> also performed integrative analysis of exome/genome sequencing, transcriptome, and copy number aberrations in 29 SCLC. They reported <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> inactivation, mutations in <italic>PTEN, SLIT2</italic>, and <italic>EPHA2</italic>, and recurrent mutation of histone modifiers e.g. <italic>CREBBP, EP300</italic>, and <italic>MLL</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>.</p>
    <p>Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs) are known to modify epigenetic status and repress their target genes to establish and maintain the cell fates<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. EZH2 is a catalytic component of PRC2 and functions as a histone methyltransferase for H3 lysine 27 residue (H3K27), and its overexpression in cancer was reported first in prostate cancer, followed by breast cancer. EZH2 overexpression correlates to cancer progression and poorer prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. On the other hand, SWI/SNF antagonizes PRCs and activates PRC target genes and contributes to cell differentiation. Mutation in proteins in SWI/SNF complex leads to loss of antagonistic function to polycomb complex protein<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Those mutations or high expression of EZH2 may play a role in maintenance of cell stemness and thus carcinogenesis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>. As for lung cancer, 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), an inhibitor of PRC2, inhibits growth of non-small cell lung cancer cells compared to non-cancerous bronchial epithelial and fibroblast cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis suggested that elevated EZH2 expression is associated with non-small cell lung cancer progression and metastasis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>.</p>
    <p>Involvement of PRC2 in SCLC, however, has not been elucidated. Here we report high expression levels of <italic>EZH2</italic> and other PRC2 components in SCLC. Genes with H3K27me3(+) in SCLC cell lines but H3K27me3(−) in normal small airway epithelial cell (SAEC), (i) did not overlap with PRC2-target genes in ES cells, (ii) showed lower expression levels not only in SCLC cell lines but also in clinical SCLC samples, and (iii) showed significant enrichment of GO-terms e.g. immune response, cell adhesion, and plasma membrane. While <italic>JUB</italic> is the most repressed gene with such GO-terms and with H3K27me3 mark in all the three SCLC cell lines, <italic>JUB</italic> introduction lead to growth inhibition. Shorter overall survival of clinical SCLC cases correlated to repression of <italic>JUB</italic> alone, or a set of four genes including PRC target genes and marker genes of classic type SCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>. It is suggested that high expression of PRC2 contributes to gene repression in SCLC, and the gene repression may play a role in genesis of SCLC.</p>

        <title>Microarray expression analysis in SCLC and normal tissues</title>
        <p>Gene expressions in 23 clinical SCLC samples and 42 normal tissues including the normal lung were analyzed on genome-wide scale using microarray, and average expression levels of SCLC were compared to those of normal tissues. Among 11,037 genes with Genechip score &gt;200 in at least one sample, 71 genes showed higher expression in SCLC by &gt;10-fold compared to normal tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Table S1</xref>). The most highly expressed genes in SCLC samples included <italic>GRP</italic>, <italic>INSM1</italic> and <italic>ASCL1</italic>, which were reported to be highly expressed in classic type SCLC with neuroendocrine features<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, <italic>TOP2A</italic>, which encodes a DNA topoisomerase active in fast-growing tumors and is a target of chemotherapy in SCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, and <italic>EZH2</italic>, a member of PRC2 and a methyltransferase for histone H3 lysine K27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>). Other PRC2 members, <italic>SUZ12</italic> and <italic>EED</italic>, were also highly expressed in SCLC compared to the normal tissues. The expression levels of PRC2 members in SCLC were also significantly higher than squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Mapping of histone modification</title>
        <p>We performed ChIP-seq for H3K27me3 mark in three SCLC cell lines and in SAEC, and obtained 9280, 9352, 15704 and 7589 peaks in Lu130, H209, DMS53, and SAEC, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2a</xref>). We then prepared ChIP samples by additionally performed ChIP experiments, and performed quantitative ChIP-PCR to validate ChIP-seq results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2b</xref>). To confirm overlapping of H3K27me3(+) regions and PRC2-target regions, we also performed ChIP-seq for SUZ12 in a SCLC cell line Lu130. SUZ12(+) regions were well-overlapped to H3K27me3(+) regions as reported<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Genes with and without H3K27me3 around promoter region (within ± 2kb from transcription start site) were regarded as H3K27me3(+) and H3K27me3(−) genes, respectively. When expression levels of H3K27me3(+) genes were compared to H3K27me3(−) genes within each sample, H3K27me3(+) genes showed significant repression: 0.11-fold in SAEC, 0.27-fold in Lu130, 0.08-fold in H209, and 0.11-fold in DMS53 (P &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−20</sup>, <italic>t</italic>-test), confirming that ChIP-seq analysis for H3K27me3 was properly performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2c</xref>).</p>
        <p>These H3K27me3(+) genes were compared with reported PRC2-target genes in ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>. Genes with H3K27me3 in SAEC only or genes with H3K27me3 in both SAEC and SCLC cell lines, showed significant overlap with PRC2-target genes in ES cells. Genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC cell lines but not in SAEC, however, were not significantly overlapped with PRC2-target genes in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>Genes repressed with H3K27me3 in SCLC</title>
        <p>The 8,654 genes showing H3K27me3(−) in 3 SCLC cell lines and also H3K27me3(−) in SAEC (SCLC(3-)SAEC(−) genes), showed similar expression levels among SAEC, 3 SCLC cell lines, the normal lung, other normal tissues, and clinical SCLC cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>). But the 644 genes showing H3K27me3(+) in 1 of 3 SCLC cell lines but H3K27me3(−) in SAEC (SCLC(1+)SAEC(−) genes), showed lower expression levels in SCLC cell lines as well as clinical SCLC cases compared to the SCLC(3-)SAEC(−) genes. The 343 genes showing H3K27me3(+) in 2 or 3 SCLC cell lines but H3K27me3(−) in SAEC (SCLC(2or3+)SAEC(−) genes), showed further reduced expression levels in SCLC cell lines as well as clinical SCLC cases compared to the SCLC(3-)SAEC(−) genes. These data indicated that genes with H3K27me3(+) in SCLC cell lines were significantly repressed not only in the analyzed SCLC cell lines, but also in clinical SCLC samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3a</xref>).</p>
        <p>When genes were sorted by fold expression level between SAEC and mean of 3 SCLC cell lines in descending order, the SCLC (2or3+)SAEC(−) genes were significantly enriched downward (P &lt; 1 × 10<sup>−15</sup>, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), i.e. were significantly repressed in SCLC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3b</xref>). The 343 SCLC(2or3+) SAEC(−) genes showed significant enrichment of GO-terms e.g. immune response (P = 5.1 × 10<sup>−14</sup>), cell adhesion (P = 1.7 × 10<sup>−8</sup>) and other similar terms in Biological Process, which were different from GO-terms of PRC2-target genes in ES cells related to differentiation and development. Extracellular region (P = 1.3 × 10<sup>−23</sup>), plasma membrane (P = 8.1 × 10<sup>−21</sup>) and other similar GO-terms were enriched in Cellular Component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Fig. 3c</xref>).</p>

        <title>Introduction of repressed genes in SCLC cell line</title>
        <p>Genes possessing H3K27me3 mark in all the three SCLC cell lines, and relating to the four GO-terms of immune response, cell adhesion, extracellular region, or plasma membrane, were sorted by fold expression level between SAEC and mean of 3 SCLC cell lines in descending order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>). The most repressed genes were <italic>JUB</italic> and <italic>PTRF</italic>, which showed decreased expression to 0.01-fold in SCLC cell lines compared to SAEC, and H3K27me3 mark specifically in SCLC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4b</xref>). These two genes were introduced in an SCLC cell line DMS53 using lentiviral system, and the protein expressions were confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. S3</xref>). JUB was distributed to the cellular membrane, while PTRF was localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5b</xref>). Introduction of <italic>JUB</italic> inhibited cellular growth, whereas introduction of <italic>PTRF</italic> did not affect cellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Fig. 5c</xref>), suggesting that the most repressed gene related to cell adhesion, <italic>JUB</italic>, might function as a growth-suppressor in SCLC cells and its repression by PRC2 might contribute to genesis of SCLC.</p>

      <sec disp-level="2">
        <title>JUB repression correlated to shorter survival</title>
        <p>Since gene repression by PRC2 was suggested to contribute to genesis of SCLC, we wanted to analyze whether the repression correlated to poorer prognosis of clinical SCLC or not. We therefore examined the dependency of overall survival time on <italic>JUB</italic> and other highly repressed PRC-target genes (<italic>PTRF</italic>, <italic>DMKN</italic>, <italic>AXL</italic>, <italic>EPHB4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4a</xref>) as well as highly expressed PRC2 complex genes (<italic>EZH2</italic>, <italic>SUZ12</italic>, <italic>EED</italic>) and also highly expressed classic type marker genes (<italic>GRP</italic>, <italic>INSM1</italic>, <italic>ASCL1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1a</xref>), using the Cox proportional-hazards regression. Repression of <italic>JUB</italic> or <italic>EPHB4</italic> showed strong correlation to shorter survival (P = 0.002 or P = 0.007, respectively), while high expression of classic type marker, <italic>GRP</italic>, also correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6a</xref>). The most relevant predictor variables were analyzed by the AIC based criteria, the stepAIC function of R software, and a set of four genes, <italic>JUB</italic>, <italic>EPHB4</italic>, <italic>GRP</italic> and <italic>ASCL1</italic>, was selected as the most relevant one (P = 0.0001) among all the possible combination of one through 11 genes. The K-means sample clustering with the four genes using Orange software<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref> showed that the optimal cluster size was two, and the two groups of samples were shown by the multi dimensional scaling plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6b</xref>). The one group (namely Group-L) could be simply characterized with low <italic>JUB</italic> and high <italic>GRP</italic> expression, and the other one (namely Group-H), opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>).

Group-L showed shorter overall survival than Group-H (P = 0.02, log-rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6d</xref>).</p>

        <title>Treatment of SCLC cell lines with EZH2 inhibitors</title>
        <p>To get insight into clinical application of EZH2 inhibitors on SCLC, we next analyzed effect of an EZH2 inhibitor, DZNep<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>, on the three SCLC cell lines <italic>in vitro</italic>.

WST-8 assay showed repression of cellular growth in the three SCLC cell lines, suggesting that EZH2 inhibitors might be effective for therapy on SCLC.</p>
        <p>SCLC cell lines were then treated with a selective EZH2 inhibitor, GSK126, at different doses of 0.5, 2, and 8 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Fig. 7b</xref>). All the three cell lines showed substantial inhibition of cellular growth at high dose (8 μM).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We here report high expression levels of EZH2 and other PRC2 components in SCLC. Genes targeted by PRC2 in SCLC cell lines were shown to be repressed in SCLC cell lines and clinical SCLC samples. While <italic>JUB</italic> is the most repressed gene with H3K27me3 mark in all the three SCLC cell lines, <italic>JUB</italic> introduction lead to growth inhibition of SCLC cells. Shorter overall survival of clinical SCLC cases significantly correlated to lower expression of <italic>JUB</italic> alone (P = 0.002), or a set of PRC2 target genes (<italic>JUB</italic>, <italic>EPHB4</italic>) and classic type marker genes (<italic>GRP</italic>, <italic>ASCL1</italic>) (P = 0.0001). Treatment of three SCLC cell lines with EZH2 inhibitors, DZNep and GSK126, induced growth inhibition. These data suggested that high expression of PRC2 contributed to gene repression in SCLC, and the repression may play a role in worse prognosis of SCLC.</p>
      <p>PRC2 complex has a histone methyltransferase activity and represses gene expression by methylation of H3K27 residue. PRC2-target genes in ES cells<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref> show enrichment of genes related to development and differentiation, and repression of those genes in ES cells or adult tissue stem cells plays a role in maintenance of stemness<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In this study, genes with H3K27me3 in SAEC only and genes with H3K27me3 both in SAEC and SCLC cells were significantly overlapped with PRC2-target genes in ES cells, and showed enrichment of GO-terms such as development and differentiation, similar to PRC2-target genes in ES cells. Genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC cells but not in SAEC, however, were not overlapped with PRC2-target genes in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Fig. 2d</xref>). It might be suggested that H3K27me3 marks in SCLC might be extended to not only PRC2-target genes in ES cells but also other target genes such as cellular adhesion-related genes, due to highly expressed PRC2 components.</p>
      <p>It was reported that high expression levels of EZH2 in prostate cancer and breast cancer correlated to metastasis and invasion, and thus poorer prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Inhibition of PRC2 by DZNep treatment resulted in growth inhibition of cancer cell lines with high expression of EZH2, compared to normal cell lines. <italic>DAB21P</italic> and <italic>p21</italic><sup>CDKN1A</sup> were reported to be PRC2 target genes and play a role in these cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. In SCLC, high expression of EZH2 may extend PRC2-target genes including <italic>JUB</italic>, and its repression in SCLC correlated to poorer prognosis. DZNep treatment of SCLC cell lines also resulted in growth inhibition, while DZNep is known as PRC2 inhibitor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recently, EZH2-specific inhibitors were reported to be developed and effective to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. Although GSK126 induced loss of H3K27me3 independent of EZH2 mutation status, six of seven lymphoma cell lines sensitive to GSK126 treatment were <italic>EZH2</italic>-mutation(+), while only two of 11 lymphoma cell lines less sensitive to GSK126 were <italic>EZH2</italic>-mutation(+). It was suggested that lymphoma cell lines with mutant EZH2 tend to be dependent on EZH2 activity on cell growth<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. In our study, two of three SCLC cell lines showed growth inhibition in part at lower doses of GSK126. It might be suggested that elevated EZH2 in SCLC could induce the dependence of cellular growth on EZH2 activity, like the reported seven sensitive lymphoma cell lines (six EZH2-mutation(+) and one EZH2-mutation(−) cells), but that co-occurring alterations could perhaps weaken the dependency on EZH2 in some SCLC cells. PRC2-target medicine may become an important therapeutic strategy against cancer including SCLC, and application of EZH2-specific inhibitors should be further analyzed for SCLC.</p>
      <p>While introduction of <italic>JUB</italic> showed growth suppression, introduction of <italic>PTRF</italic> had no effect. PTRF as well as CAV1 is known as structural component of caveolae, 50–100 nm flask-shaped invaginations of plasma membrane involved in numerous signal transductions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>. Whereas CAV1 was reported as a tumor suppressor<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> and PTRF was required for premature senescence induction through interaction with CAV1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, CAV1 was also strongly repressed in the three SCLC cell lines and clinical SCLC samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="s1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Introduction of <italic>PTRF</italic> together with <italic>CAV1</italic> might be necessary to rule out tumor-suppressive function of <italic>PTRF</italic> in SCLC. Beside <italic>JUB</italic> and <italic>PTRF</italic>, genes with H3K27me3 in SCLC but not in SAEC included <italic>EPHB4</italic>, <italic>WNT7A</italic>, <italic>COL18A1</italic>, and <italic>THBD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Fig. 4</xref>). <italic>EPHB4</italic> was reported to be a tumor suppressor gene silenced by DNA hypermethylation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and transduction of <italic>EPHB4</italic> resulted in down-regulation of phosphorylated Akt<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. <italic>WNT7A</italic> was reported to be decreased in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and its transfection into NSCLC cell lines reversed malignant phenotype<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. COL18A1 is cleaved to be Endostatin, an endogenous inhibitor of angiogenesis, and systemic administration of recombinant Endostatin inhibited growth of transplanted cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. <italic>THBD</italic> was reported to be a tumor suppressor gene silenced by DNA hypermethylation in cancers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>, and its suppression correlated to tumor invasion and poor prognosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Repression of these genes with H3K27me3 modification may also contribute to genesis of SCLC.</p>
      <p>A cell adhesion-related protein JUB harbors LIM domain and is recruited to cadherin-dependent cell-cell adhesive complexes to form stable cell-cell junction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>. JUB was also reported to bind to PRMT5 and repress SNAIL target genes in the nucleus<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>, and accumulation of JUB in the nucleus of P19 embryonal cells resulted in growth inhibition and spontaneous endodermal differentiation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>. In this study, introduction of <italic>JUB</italic> in an SCLC cell DMS53 resulted in growth repression, but the protein was distributed mainly to the cellular membrane, not in the nucleus. It is yet to be elucidated whether the protein distributed to cell-cell adhesive complexes functions as growth suppressor.</p>
      <p>Classic type of SCLC with neuroendocrine feature is characterized with expression of GRP as well as L-dopa-decarboxylase, neuron specific enolase, and creatine kinase-BB isoenzyme<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. ASCL1 is essential for development of neuroendocrine cells and also highly expressed in classic SCLC, and knock-down of ASCL1 inhibited colony formation in soft agar and induced apoptosis in SCLC<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>. Whereas <italic>JUB</italic> repression alone significantly correlated to shorter survival (P = 0.002), SCLC was classified into two groups with distinct prognosis using a set of PRC2 target genes (<italic>JUB</italic>, <italic>EPHB4</italic>) and classic type marker genes (<italic>GRP</italic>, <italic>ASCL1</italic>), and the group with poorer outcome could be simply characterized with low expression of <italic>JUB</italic> and high expression of <italic>GRP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Fig. 6c</xref>). Further study is necessary whether these expressions are independent phenomena or features of classic type SCLC include gene repression with H3K27me3.</p>
      <p>In summary, PRC2 components were highly expressed in SCLC and contributed to gene repression, and the repression may play a role in genesis of SCLC.</p>

        <p>(a) For five of repressed PRC-target genes (<italic>downward arrow</italic>) and six of highly expressed genes (<italic>upward arrow</italic>), the dependency of overall survival time of SCLC cases on each gene was analyzed using the Cox proportional-hazards regression, e.g. P = 0.002 for <italic>JUB</italic>. Among all the possible combination of one through 11 genes, the most relevant predictor variables were the set of the four genes, <italic>JUB</italic>, <italic>EPHB4</italic>, <italic>GRP</italic> and <italic>ASCL1</italic> (<italic>bottom</italic>, P = 0.0001). (b) The K-means sample clustering using the four genes showed that the optimal cluster size of SCLC cases was two, and the two groups of samples (<italic>blue</italic> and <italic>red</italic> spots) were shown by the multi dimensional scaling plot. (c) The one group (<italic>blue</italic>) could be simply characterized with low <italic>JUB</italic> and high <italic>GRP</italic> expression, and thus called Group-L. The other one (<italic>red</italic>) showed high <italic>JUB</italic> and low <italic>GRP</italic> expression, and thus called Group-H.
