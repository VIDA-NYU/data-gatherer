********************
Data Gatherer
********************

*Data Gatherer* is a tool for automating the extraction of datasets from scientific article webpages.
It integrates large language models (LLMs), dynamic prompt management, and rule-based parsing
to support data harmonization in biomedical researchâ€”and potentially beyond.

When a dataset is found, Data Gatherer classifies its access type into one of four categories:

1. **Easy download**
   Three or fewer files, publicly accessible.

2. **Complex download**
   Four or more files, publicly accessible.

3. **Application to access**
   Requires application through a centralized process with clear procedures.

4. **Contact to access**
   Requires reaching out to the data provider; procedures are unclear or informal.
