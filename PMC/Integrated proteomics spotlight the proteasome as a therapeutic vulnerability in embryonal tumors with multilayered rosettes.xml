      <p>Despite recent advances in the molecular characterization of embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR), the prognosis for these rare pediatric brain tumors remains extremely poor. Proteomics have not been studied in ETMR yet, but hold the prospect to closely reflect functionally relevant tumor features. We performed integrated proteome analyses to provide a comprehensive view on novel as well as highly conserved molecular features of ETMR. Our investigations revealed an abundance of proteasome regulatory proteins in ETMR and demonstrated the therapeutic potential of proteasome inhibition in vitro. Our findings provide valuable insight into ETMR molecular biology and pave the way for novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

    <p>Embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR) are rare and highly malignant brain tumors, which predominantly affect infants.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> ETMR can be categorized into three histological variants: embryonal tumor with abundant neuropil and true rosettes (ETANTR), ependymoblastoma (EBL), or medulloepithelioma (MEPL). ETANTR feature vast areas of neuropil intermixed with rosette-forming and dense clusters of primitive, undifferentiated cells. EBL predominantly display dense sheets of primitive cells forming multilayered rosettes. MEPL morphology is epithelioid and reminiscent of the primitive neural tube. Of note, morphological features tend to overlap between the different histological variants and ETMR may also shift between variants upon relapse.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2–4</xref></sup> ETANTR, EBL, and MEPL do not significantly differ in their epigenomic profiles or clinical presentations, which suggests that they have a common origin and share core biological features.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
    <p>ETMR are molecularly characterized by distinct DNA methylation signatures and dysregulated expression of oncogenic miRNAs.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Amplifications of 19q13.42 encoding the primate-specific miRNA cluster C19MC are the most frequent recurrent genomic alterations in ETMR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Remaining cases often harbor mutations affecting DICER1, a ribonuclease involved in miRNA processing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Recently, dysregulated miRNA processing has been linked to R-loop-associated chromosomal instability and upregulated DNA repair mechanisms in ETMR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p>
    <p>As of today, the prognosis for ETMR remains extremely poor with a median time to death of under 12 months despite intensive treatment efforts.<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Further advancements in the molecular characterization of ETMR are urgently needed to improve current treatment regimens and develop novel therapeutic strategies. Proteomics has not been studied in ETMR yet, but holds out the prospect to reflect functionally relevant tumor features more closely. In this study we aimed to explore the proteome landscape of a case series of molecularly confirmed ETMR and the ETMR cell line BT183. We integrated proteome, transcriptome, and methylome data of embryonal brain tumors to provide an extended perspective on molecular features of ETMR and identify novel therapeutic vulnerabilities.</p>

        <title>Human Tissue</title>
        <p>Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human tumor tissue of ETMR, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) and medulloblastoma (MB) were acquired from the Institute of Neuropathology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE), Hamburg, the Center for Neuropathology, Ludwig Maximilians University (LMU), Munich, and the Division of Neuropathology, Basel University Hospital. Ethics approval was waived by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians (PV6007). The use of all tissue specimens for research upon anonymization was in accordance with local and national ethical standards and with the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its later amendments.</p>

        <title>Histology and Immunohistochemistry</title>
        <p>Tissue samples were fixed in 4% buffered formaldehyde, dehydrated, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned at 2 µm. H&amp;E staining was performed according to standard laboratory protocols. Immunohistochemical stainings were performed on a Ventana BenchMark XT system (Roche Diagnostics). The following primary antibodies were used: SALL4 (ab57577, abcam, 1:50), Ki67 (SP6, Cell Marque, 1:750), SOX2 (ab97959, abcam, 1:1000), MAP2C (M4403, Sigma–Aldrich, 1:3000), CD56 (MSK006, Zytomed, 1:2000), Synaptophysin (M7315, Dako, 1:500). As a chromogen, 3,3ʹ-diaminobenzine (DAB) was used.</p>

        <title>Sample Preparation for Mass Spectrometry</title>
        <p>Punch biopsies and/or microdissected tissue sections were collected from FFPE embryonal brain tumors. For whole sample analyses, care was taken to compile samples, which sufficiently portray the histomorphology of the entire tumor. For paraffin removal, samples were incubated in 0.5 ml n-heptane at room temperature for 30 min, using a ThermoMixer (ThermoMixer 5436, Eppendorf). Samples were centrifuged at 14 000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was discarded. Samples were reconditioned with 70% ethanol and centrifuged at 14 000 g for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded. The procedure was repeated twice. Deparaffinized tissue samples and fresh frozen cell pellets were dissolved in 150 µL 1% w/v sodium deoxycholate (SDC) in 0.1 M triethylammonium bicarbonate buffer (TEAB) and incubated for 1 h at 95 °C for reverse formalin fixation. Samples were sonicated for 5 s at an energy of 25% to destroy interfering DNA. A bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay was performed (Pierce™ BCA Protein Assay Kit, Thermo Scientific) to determine the protein concentration, following the manufacturer’s instructions. Tryptic digestion was performed for 20 μg protein, using the single-pot, solid-phase-enhanced sample preparation (SP3) protocol, as described by Hughes et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> Eluted peptides were dried in a Savant SpeedVac Vacuum Concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and stored at −20 °C until further use. Directly prior to measurement dried peptides were resolved in 0.1% FA to a final concentration of 1 μg/μL. In total 1 μg was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis.</p>

        <title>Mass Spectrometry Analyses</title>
        <p>Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometer (LC–MS/MS) measurements were performed on a quadrupole-ion-trap-orbitrap mass spectrometer (MS, QExactive, Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a nano-UPLC (Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC system, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tryptic peptides were injected into the LC system via an autosampler, purified, and desalted by using a reversed-phase trapping column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18 trap; 100 μm × 2 cm, 100 A pore size, 5 μm particle size; Thermo Fisher Scientific), and thereafter separated with a reversed-phase column (Acclaim PepMap 100 C18; 75 μm × 25 cm, 100 A pore size, 2 μm particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Trapping was performed for 5 min at a flow rate of 5 µL/min with 98% solvent A (0.1% FA) and 2% solvent B (0.1% FA in ACN). Separation and elution of peptides were achieved by a linear gradient from 2% to 30% solvent B in 65 min at a flow rate of 0.3 µL/min. Eluting peptides were ionized by using a nano-electrospray ionization source (nano-ESI) with a spray voltage of 1800 V, transferred into the MS, and analyzed in data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode. For each MS1 scan, ions were accumulated for a maximum of 240 ms or until a charge density of 1 × 1^6 ions (AGC target) was reached. Fourier-transformation-based mass analysis of the data from the orbitrap mass analyzer was performed by covering a mass range of 400—1200 <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> with a resolution of 70 000 at <italic toggle="yes">m</italic>/<italic toggle="yes">z</italic> = 200.

        <p>LC–MS/MS raw spectra were searched against a reviewed human Swissprot database, obtained in February 2022, containing 20 300 entries, using the SEQUEST algorithm integrated into the Proteome Discoverer software (v 3.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). A maximum number of 2 missing tryptic cleavages was set. Peptides between 6 and 144 amino acids were considered. Carbamidomethylation was set as a fixed modification for cysteine residues and the oxidation of methionine, and pyro-glutamate formation at glutamine residues at the peptide N-terminus, as well as acetylation of the protein N-terminus was allowed as variable modifications. A strict cutoff (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01) was set for peptide and protein identification. Protein quantification was carried out, using the Minora Algorithm, implemented in Proteome Discoverer. For quantification, only unique peptides were used. Retrieved protein abundancies were normalized at the protein level, using all proteins quantified. Scaling was disabled. Protein abundances were log2 transformed and normalized using sample-wise median centering.</p>

        <p>We, therefore, hypothesized that the ETMR neuropil portrays the histomorphological correlate of neuronal differentiation, and suspected that the ETMR neuropil directs the proteome subgroup affiliation. Immunohistochemical stainings (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1H</xref>–AE) confirmed that tumor cells in areas with undifferentiated, rosette-like, or epithelioid morphology of EBL/MEPL cases, as well as rosette structures of ETANTR cases were immunopositive for stemness- and proliferation-associated markers like SOX2, KI67, and SALL4. In contrast, the neuropil-rich areas of ETANTR, were immunonegative for these markers, but instead stained intensely for neuronal markers like CD56, MAP2C, and synaptophysin.</p>

Three of the 16 ETMR (cases #5, #11 and #12) were exceptionally heterogeneous and showed vast, well-demarcated areas of either neuropil-rich (ETANTR-like) or primitive (EBL/MEPL-like) architecture. Both areas were microdissected and separately subjected to proteome measurements in all 3 cases (Figure 2A).

This finding was of particular interest since it represented a highly significant novel molecular feature of ETMR that did not associate with intratumoral histomorphology-based heterogeneity and was not reflected on preceding levels of gene expression regulation, i.e. RNA or DNA methylation (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–Q</xref>). We integrated our proteome data set of embryonal brain tumors with publicly available protein data of other pediatric brain tumors, comprising the tumor entities ependymoma, craniopharyngioma, ganglioglioma, high- and low-grade glioma as well as further AT/RT and MB cases.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Comparisons across pediatric brain tumor entities demonstrated that proteasome regulatory protein abundance was the highest in ETMR (***<italic toggle="yes">P</italic> &lt; .001), underlining the distinctiveness of this molecular feature (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5R</xref> and <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">S</xref>).</p>

        <title>Proteasome Inhibition Poses a Promising Therapeutic Approach in ETMR</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that the abundance of proteasome regulatory proteins reflects a strong dependency of ETMR on the proteasome to safeguard proteostasis. To prove this concept in vitro, we proceeded to investigate the embryonal brain tumor cell line BT183, which was derived from a C19MC-amplified ETMR with large areas of neuropil in the posterior fossa of a 2-year-old boy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Proteome data were generated from BT183, as well as the AT/RT cell line BT16, and the MB cell line D283. The proteome profiles of these cell lines adequately matched with their respective tumor entity (Figure 6A). Of note, the BT183 proteome profile best matched with ETANTR profiles (<xref rid="sup8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplementary Figure 8A–E</xref>) and, in analogy to the results derived from ETMR tissue samples, showed ETMR-characteristic significant abundance of proteins associated with microtubule-based processes and DNA repair (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3K</xref>; <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">D</xref>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">C</xref>). Moreover, as in the tissue samples, proteasome regulatory particles were highly abundant and NADH dehydrogenase activity proteins were significantly less abundant in BT183 compared to BT16 and D283 (Figure 4B; <xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Figure 5A–E</xref>; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">F</xref>). We therefore concluded that these cell lines were suitable to test the potential therapeutic vulnerability of ETMR against proteasome inhibition and proceeded to perform in vitro experiments. All cell lines were treated with the CNS-penetrant proteasome inhibitor Marizomib and assayed for cell viability. We found that BT183 was exceptionally vulnerable toward treatment with Marizomib (IC50 = 56 nM) compared to BT16 and D283 (IC50s ≈ 443 nM, and 333 nM, respectively; <xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig">Figure 6D</xref>). In summary, we demonstrated that proteasome regulatory particle abundance is a distinctive, histology-independent feature of ETMR and that proteasome inhibition represents a promising therapeutic vulnerability in ETMR.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The main ETMR-related novel findings of this report comprise (i) the close association of histomorphology and proteome signatures, (ii) an outline of tumor-specific molecular features depicted on different levels of gene expression regulation, (iii) an abundance of proteasome regulatory proteins, and (iv) the detection of proteasome inhibition as a promising therapeutic vulnerability. As embryonal brain tumors, especially ETMR, are quite rare, our study is limited by rather small case numbers. Consequently, not all molecular subtypes may be sufficiently represented in our series. For example, our series comprised only 2 non-C19MC-altered ETMR.</p>
      <p>Based on transcriptome data, Lambo et al. previously linked miRNA-related aberrations to R-loop-associated chromosomal instability with high DNA repair expression and helicase activity in ETMR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> As we also identified RNA processing mechanisms, gene silencing by miRNA, DNA repair, and helicase activity to be reflected on the proteome level, our study confirms these molecular features of ETMR. Roles of Hippo, NOTCH, WNT, and SHH signaling have also been described in ETMR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Although several respective relevant gene set members were identified in our data, we could not confirm a significant enrichment of these pathways on the proteome level. However, statistical analyses revealed tendencies of enrichment, therefore these results might change with higher case numbers. Also, the reference samples used in this study may have affected the analytical results, since several subtypes of embryonal tumors rely on congruent pathway activations (e.g. SHH- and WNT-signaling in MB-SHH and MB-WNT, respectively). A recent study suggested that <italic toggle="yes">C19MC</italic> and LIN28A drive ETMR progression via a MYCN-mediated core transcriptional regulatory circuitry involving super-enhancer transcription factors.<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Transcription factors are generally expressed with low abundancies and therefore, their detection is limited in proteome analyses.<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Accordingly, major members of this transcriptional regulatory network such as MYCN, MAZ, SOX11, SALL1, and SP3<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> were not detected in our analyses.</p>
      <p>We show that proteome signatures of ETMR are closely associated with histomorphological features. Previous studies have suggested a similar association between the ETMR transcriptome and histomorphology. In detail, transcriptional signatures related to DNA repair mechanisms were reported in ETMR rosettes whereas transcripts of astroglial differentiation were found in ETMR neuropil.<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Although neuropil was characterized by a neuronal rather than an astroglial signature in our study, we generally confirm the close linkage of ETMR histomorphology and gene expression features. Importantly, distinctive markers of intratumoral heterogeneity showed similar expression patterns in the previously published transcriptome analyses of microdissected ETMR regions and our proteome analyses.</p>
      <p>Notably, transcriptomic subgroups relating to histomorphology have not been described in ETMR. In line with this, we detected no association of ETMR histological subtypes and clustering based on transcriptome profiles upon reviewing the annotations of the public data deposits used in this study. This may be because the entire tumor gives name to its histological variant, and analyzed specimens may not have been purposely compiled to representatively portray the histomorphology of the entire tumor. Moreover, the histological subtyping of ETMR may be subject to interobserver variability.</p>
      <p>The question arises as to whether the association of morphology and proteome signatures has clinical implications in ETMR. Previous studies demonstrated that overall survival times do not significantly differ between ETMR histological variants.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> On the other hand, multiple reports have indicated a linkage between long-term survival and neuronal differentiation in some ETMR.<sup><xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38–40</xref></sup> Thus, higher case numbers are needed to clarify if and how neuronal or histomorphology-associated proteome signatures may relate to better survival chances in ETMR. Moreover, differential proteomics associated with histomorphological variations between and within ETMR may warrant histology-oriented therapeutic approaches. For example, prevailingly undifferentiated tumors with EBL/MEPL-like morphology harbored DNA topoisomerases in abundance and may thus be more vulnerable towards treatment with anthracyclins.<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> On the other hand, neuropil-rich tumors showed upregulated synaptic signaling, which implies that antiepileptic drugs like levetiracetam may be beneficial as adjuvant cancer therapeutics in ETANTR and even exhibit antitumoral effects.<sup><xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup></p>
      <p>Since histomorphology-associated intratumoral proteome heterogeneity may facilitate tumor evolution under therapeutic selection pressure, we focused on pervasive proteome features of ETMR in this study. Among these features, we discovered understudied molecular characteristics of ETMR, which were not reflected in previously investigated levels of gene expression. For example, we discovered a low abundance of proteins involved in mitochondrial respiration in ETMR. Mitochondrial metabolism has been implicated in multi-functional roles in malignant tumor progression<sup><xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> and also is linked to sensitivity towards proteasome inhibition in cancers.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> The roles of mitochondria for tumorigenesis and progression in ETMR are widely unknown.<sup><xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup></p>
      <p>The proteasome is an essential multi-subunit complex, which maintains proteostasis by degrading misfolded or damaged proteins.<sup><xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> Proteasome regulatory particles regulate the entry and delivery of proteins to the complex’s catalytic core.<sup><xref rid="CIT0050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> Previous studies have linked high levels of proteasome regulatory particles to cytotoxic sensitivity towards proteasome inhibition.<sup><xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> Proteasome regulatory particles were highly abundant in ETMR and BT183 cells, while in vitro assays demonstrated the vulnerability of ETMR cells toward proteasome inhibition using Marizomib. In line with our findings, a previous drug screen in BT183 tumor cells identified the proteasome-inhibitor Bortezomib as a potent in vitro ETMR drug candidate.<sup><xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> However, since Bortezomib does not cross the blood–brain barrier, its clinical potential for ETMR treatment was not further pursued in vivo.<sup><xref rid="CIT0052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> In recent years, the CNS penetrant proteasome-inhibitor Marizomib has gained attention in the treatment of hematopoietic and solid tumor models.<sup><xref rid="CIT0054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> A previous drug screen by Lin et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> identified the potential of Marizomib to treat cell culture models of diffuse midline glioma (DMG), H3K27 altered. Subsequently, a Phase I study was initiated to investigate Marizomib safety and preliminary efficacy in children with DMG (NCT04341311). A recently published report of this study proclaimed that children tolerated starting doses of Marizomib (0.6 mg/m²) without any dose-limiting toxicities or CNS toxicity.<sup><xref rid="CIT0057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> Notably, Marizomib IC50s of the 6 DMG cell lines used in the study of Lin et al.<sup><xref rid="CIT0056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> were in the range of 10—100 nM and therefore comparable to BT183. Taken together, these results substantiate the therapeutic potential of proteasome inhibition and provide a rationale for future clinical trials to employ Marizomib in ETMR therapy.</p>
