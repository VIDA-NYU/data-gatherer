      <p id="Par3">Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is one of the deadliest human cancers, with a 5 year survival rate of less than 7%<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. The standard of care for extensive-stage SCLC consists of systemic treatment with platinum and etoposide, recently combined with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. One peculiarity of SCLC is its typically high sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy followed by rapid recurrence, which distinguishes it from most other human cancers. Unfortunately, second-line treatment with other chemotherapeutics or immunotherapy is only marginally effective and patients ultimately succumb to their disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par4">We and others have previously performed large-scale genome sequencing to comprehensively characterize cancer genome alterations in SCLC, which showed universal biallelic losses of the tumour suppressors <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>, additional alterations to histone-modifying enzymes and cell cycle regulators, and <italic>MYC</italic> transcription factor amplifications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. Furthermore, SCLC subgroups were defined on the basis of the expression of neuroendocrine lineage transcription factors, which impact tumour biology and treatment outcome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>. Finally, preliminary studies have provided initial clues in regard to molecular pathways associated with resistance to chemotherapy<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>.</p>
      <p id="Par5">Despite progress in characterization of the molecular basis of SCLC, the underlying patterns of clonal evolution and the mechanisms causing drug resistance have remained unclear. We suggest that cancer genome alterations not only drive malignant transformation in SCLC but also influence the clinical phenotypes of chemotherapy sensitivity, tumour progression and relapse. We therefore performed comprehensive multiregional and longitudinal studies of tumours obtained from 65 patients to decipher the evolutionary and genomic principles that govern response and resistance to therapy in SCLC.</p>

      <title>Tumour specimens and clinical data</title>
      <p id="Par6">We collected 160 tumour specimens from 65 patients with SCLC under institutional review board approval and performed whole-exome, genome and transcriptome sequencing of samples with an average tumour purity of 85% (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a–c</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>–<xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). We most frequently sampled the primary lung tumour, pulmonary lymph nodes, liver, pleura and brain metastases. Furthermore, patient-derived xenotransplants were established from fine-needle biopsies or circulating tumour cells (CTCs), which have been previously shown to recapitulate the genomic profiles of patients’ tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup> (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). The histology of SCLC was confirmed in all cases; additional components of adenocarcinoma or large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) were identified in three patients (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The clinical history was typical of SCLC and the majority of patients had received first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, achieving a median relapse-free interval of 88 days (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). In line with clinical guidelines<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> we grouped patients according to their duration of response to first-line chemotherapy, referring to the chemotherapy-free interval (CTFI) of 45, 90 and 180 days (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>). At relapse, 80% of these patients (<italic>n</italic> = 44 of 55) received additional lines of therapy, which included other chemotherapeutics or treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 ICIs (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Tumour samples and clinical history of 65 patients with SCLC.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Tumour sites sampled from 65 patients with SCLC.

      <p id="Par7">We analysed at least two tumour samples per patient, obtained at either single or multiple time points throughout the course of treatment. For interpatient comparisons we focused on paired studies of tumours acquired under distinct scenarios throughout the clinical course of the patients: (1) spatially distinct tumour samples in the treatment-naive setting at the time of first diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 16); (2) temporally distinct tumours acquired at first diagnosis before initiation of therapy and either during first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (<italic>n</italic> = 5) or following completion of chemotherapy (<italic>n</italic> = 42); (3) spatially, but not temporally, separate tumours analysed solely at the time of relapse (<italic>n</italic> = 14); and (4) tumours obtained before and after subsequent lines of treatment with immunotherapy (<italic>n</italic> = 7) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>, Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p>

      <title>Tumour phylogenies of metastatic SCLC</title>
      <p id="Par8">Aiming to shed light on the dynamics of genome evolution in metastatic SCLC, we performed genome sequencing of all tumour specimens to identify genomic alterations. Whole-exome sequencing data at an average coverage of 127-fold were used to compute cancer cell fraction (CCF) for somatic mutations, a metric of relative abundance of mutant alleles corrected for purity, ploidy and absolute copy number, which affords the assignment of mutations to individual tumour clones and enables tracking of single clones in spatially and temporally distinct tumours<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup> (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). We assigned mutations to the most recent common ancestor (C0) if mutations were shared and clonal with CCFs of 100% across all samples analysed, and to subclones (C1, C2 and C3) if clusters of mutations were either private to specific tumour sites or found at lower CCF. We thus reconstructed the clonal lineage and determined tumour phylogenies for all 65 patients (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec30">Supplementary Appendix</xref>, Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par9">Previous genomic studies conducted for single tumour sites obtained from treatment-naive patients indicated low levels of genomic intratumour heterogeneity in SCLC compared with lung adenocarcinoma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. Through analysis of spatially and temporally distinct tumours, we now observed a wide range in the absolute number of subclonal mutations and subclones previously observed in other cancers as well<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). Tumour phylogenies across all patients exhibited patterns of linear and branched evolution, in some cases indicating a sequential acquisition of genome alterations and thereby giving rise to a dominant clone. In other patients, emerging subclones branched from ancestral clones thus creating multiple lineages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. For systematic study of the evolutionary patterns we assigned tumour phylogenies to distinct classes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2b,c</xref>): class A, if no subclones were identified, which was frequently observed when comparing more than one anatomic site at a single time point (Fisher’s exact test, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref>); classes B and C, with one or at least two subclones, respectively, compatible with linear phylogenies; classes D and E, phylogenies with one branching event in which tumour clones descend from either C1 subclones (class D) or the common ancestral clone C0 (class E); and class F, phylogenies with at least two branching events exclusively identified in patients, with higher numbers of specimens referring to at least three spatially or temporally distinct tumours (Fisher’s exact test, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>), thus providing further information on phylogenetic complexity. To permit interpatient comparisons we therefore sought to perform paired analyses, considering a maximum of two samples per patient (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), which did not show any significant change in the absolute number of subclonal mutations but led to reduced phylogenetic complexities assigned to classes A–E (<xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). We thus observed a significantly lower clonal diversity in treatment-naive patients across different tumour sites than in temporally and spatially distinct tumours from patients undergoing treatment (**<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,e</xref>). Consequently the genomic heterogeneity of the tumour—although limited at diagnosis—increased markedly as a result of therapeutic intervention.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><title>Tumour phylogenies and clonal dynamics in 65 patients with SCLC.</title><p><bold>a</bold>, Schematic of clone phylogeny depicting the most recent common ancestral clone, C0, descending C1, C2 and C3 and subsequent subclones numbered accordingly. <bold>b</bold>, Phylogeny classes: class A, no subclones; linear phylogenies with one subclone (class B) or at least two subclones (class C); phylogenies with one branching event from C1 subclones (class D) or the common ancestral clone C0 (class E), or at least two branching events (class F). <bold>c</bold>, Number of samples and distinct time points associated with phylogeny class for each patient (Fisher’s exact test, two-sided, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01). <bold>d</bold>, Tumour phylogenies at distinct clinical scenorios determined for each patient from paired analyses of WES data (samples S1 and S2; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>), sorted according to the number of clones and subclonal mutations (top), showing site-specific CCF of identified clones (intratumour heterogeneity, middle) and phylogeny class (bottom).

      <p id="Par10">We sought to determine the subclonal composition at the time of first diagnosis to study the evolutionary dynamics of tumour progression in a highly metastatic disease. Our analysis in these treatment-naive patients included spatially distinct intra- and extrapulmonary sites exhibiting either no evidence of subclones (class A) or limited mutational changes with patterns of linear evolution (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>, left). Clonal diversity was lower when comparing metastatic sites with one another, which frequently included CTC-derived tumours and confirmed earlier observations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. However, tumour regions simultaneously obtained from the primary site and intrapulmonary metastases exhibited increased subclonal mutations (**<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01) and branched evolutionary processes (classes D and E; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). Thus, following the successful establishment of metastases, the subclonal composition appeared largely unchanged. Additionally, increased clonal heterogeneity and ongoing evolution appeared to occur during the first steps of metastatic seeding in the physical proximity of the original founder clone, driving the outgrowth of one rapidly expanding tumour.</p>
      <p id="Par11">We next analysed the impact of chemotherapy on the dynamics of tumour evolution and compared tumours before therapy with tumour sites acquired during treatment and at the time of relapse. Most tumours exhibited clonal branching from ancestral clones C1 or C0 (67%, <italic>n</italic> = 31 of 46, <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05) under therapy, causing increased site-specific intratumour heterogeneity (sample 2; Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d,e</xref>) and spatial clonal diversity when comparing specimens sampled simultaneously from different sites at relapse (**<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1d</xref>). In two patients we tracked the evolutionary processes at the site of the primary tumour before and during therapy, following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and at the time of subsequent relapse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2h</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1e</xref>). In both cases we found phylogenies of class D showing several distinct clones at the site of the primary tumour and repression of the initial dominating clone by chemotherapy, followed by the emergence and expansion of subclones descending from ancestral clone C1 that had caused relapse. Class D phylogenies were frequently identified in comparison with primary lung specimens (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2g</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 6 of seven cases), again emphasizing that the site of the primary tumour serves as a source for ancestral clones that cause metastatic seeding and tumour recurrence. At relapse, both tumour sites exposed to treatment and newly formed metastatic lesions harboured a substantial fraction of pre-existing ancestral clones, most frequently the common ancestor C0 (<italic>n</italic> = 16 of 42, 38%), confirming its critical role in relapse (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2i</xref>). Because these branching events were frequently detected in comparisons from different sites, we next analysed repeated biopsies from the same site over time (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and found branching events and the presence of ancestral clones at relapse in these as well (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1f</xref>). Furthermore, focusing the analysis on samples derived from xenotransplant models similarly showed a significant increase in subclonal mutations following treatment (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1g</xref>), suggesting no bias with regard to sample type.</p>
      <p id="Par12">Our data thus suggest that neither is the observed level of evolutionary heterogeneity driven by different anatomic sites nor does first-line chemotherapy primarily drive linear evolution of tumour clones to the state of relapse. By contrast, our data support the view that one highly proliferating clone dominates the tumour at the time of first diagnosis, representing pseudo-clonality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup> which is then suppressed and eliminated by therapy. At clinically overt recurrence, a multitude of subclones has emerged that are driven by the most recent common ancestor, which markedly increases spatial and intratumour heterogeneity.</p>

Confirming previous studies in lung cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>, age-like and tobacco-associated processes dominated within the mutations of the common ancestor, which correlated with the level of smoking in these patients (Spearman correlation = 0.39, **<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2a,b</xref>).

      <p id="Par14">We proposed that the extent of subclonal diversity and associated mutational signatures at relapse relate directly to the type and efficacy of previous treatment. Patients with clinical response to systemic treatment with first-line platinum-based chemotherapy exhibited a significant increase in subclonal mutations when analysing tumours before treatment and at relapse (**<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01); by contrast, the number of subclonal mutations in specimens before and after chemotherapy from patients with refractory SCLC did not differ significantly compared with the level of subclonality determined for multiregional samples in treatment-naive patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). These observations support the notion that treatment fails to suppress the original dominating clone in chemorefractory patients whereas successful chemotherapy eliminates the most abundant clone, which is followed by the observed expansion of a multitude of subclones.</p>
      <p id="Par15">The level of subclonal mutations differed substantially across samples (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>), and we could not identify specific mutational processes that related to the efficacy of chemotherapy in these patients (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2e</xref>). By contrast, independent of the overall clinical response, we found a significant increase in subclonal mutations when analysing those tumour sites at relapse that had also been exposed to radiotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3b</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Ionizing radiation does not typically induce signatures marked by single-base substitutions, and we could not identify other signs of radiation-induced DNA damage in tumours at relapse<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2f</xref>).

      <title>Tumour evolution under immunotherapy</title>
      <p id="Par16">We reasoned that the burst in clonal diversity induced by chemotherapy might impact the efficacy of any subsequent treatments such as ICI. We therefore analysed the evolutionary dynamics in seven patients who had received, as second- or third-line treatment, the PD-1 inhibitor nivolumab, alone or in combination with the CTLA-4 inhibitor ipilimumab (clinical trial no. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03083691">NCT03083691</ext-link>). We sampled tumour biopsies before and after treatment with ICI, and in five patients we also performed comparisons with the treatment-naive tumour acquired at the time of first diagnosis (Figs. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b,c</xref>, <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref> and <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). Two patients experienced disease stabilization throughout treatment with ICI and, in agreement with radiological disease assessment, subclonal tumour cell populations before and throughout immunotherapy were conserved (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3b,c</xref>). Two patients who progressed under immunotherapy exhibited a limited but detectable change in subclonal mutations, and assignment of tumour clones showed shifts to ancestral clones already existing before the initiation of ICI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d,e</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). Thus, tumour progression under immunotherapy led to the expansion of subclones already extant at the time of relapse. This was similarly observed in one patient who experienced an initial clinical response to ICI (S02775; Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3d</xref>). By contrast, two patients who experienced tumour shrinkage under ICI showed an increase in subclonal mutations at the time of relapse (S02764 and S03325; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3d</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3b</xref>). In comparison with corresponding treatment-naive tumours, we found that these subclones originated from ancestral clones that were dominant at the time of first diagnosis in these patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f</xref>). Thus, tumour clones that initially dominated tumour sites at the time of first diagnosis—and that had effectively been suppressed by first-line chemotherapy and not identified at the time of relapse—reappeared and provided the seed for tumours causing relapse following subsequent lines of immunotherapy. Furthermore, similar to our observation in irradiated tumours, recurring tumour clones dominating at relapse following effective immunotherapy exhibited imprints of platinum-based DNA damage (<italic>n</italic> = 4 of five patients with stable disease and partial response; Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3f,g</xref>, Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">5</xref>). The emerging subclone with signs of platinum-based DNA damage was not detectable at the time of relapse from first-line chemotherapy in two patients—before initiation of successful treatment with ICI (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref>). Of note, the tumour obtained before immunotherapy from patient S03325 contained a subclone with a signature of platinum-based DNA damage, which was different from that detected at the time of relapse post immunotherapy. Furthermore, patient S02764 was refractory to chemotherapy, with a limited subclonal drift following first-line chemotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec30">Supplementary Appendix</xref>). However, in both patients, at relapse from initially effective second-line immunotherapy, ancestral clones emerged with acquired platinum-related DNA damage, presumably acquired throughout ineffective first-line treatment with chemotherapy.</p>
      <p id="Par17">Taken together, our data show that derivatives of earlier ancestral clones persisted, despite the disappearance of the original dominating clone following first-line therapy, and then reappeared under subsequent lines of therapy thus causing clinical relapse. We could not identify any specific mutational processes or genomic patterns that resulted only from treatment with ICI and that might be indicative for effective ICI therapy. However, our data emphasize that, regardless of the efficacy of first-line treatment, ancestral clones appear to acquire platinum-induced DNA damage throughout first-line chemotherapy. Radiation, or other effective second- or third-line line therapies, can permit the subsequent expansion of these clones, even in the evolutionary short time interval of clinical care.</p>

      <title>Impact of mutations on drug sensitivity</title>
      <p id="Par23">We next sought to study how molecular features in SCLC determine the response of patients to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. Recent studies have proposed a major role for the expression of lineage transcription factors in treatment response in SCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In the present study, too, cases with predominant expression of <italic>POU2F3</italic> or <italic>NEUROD1</italic> showed a trend towards inferior relapse-free survival; however, sample size was small (<italic>n</italic> = 3) and correlations did not remain significant following correction for clinical parameters (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7a–d</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">10</xref>). Furthermore, although studies in mice have suggested a plasticity in the expression of lineage transcription factors due to tumour progression and chemotherapeutic intervention<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>, spatially and temporally distinct tumours from patients with SCLC in our cohort did not show changes in the expression of these key transcription factors<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup> (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7e</xref>). Finally, we could not observe a correlation of <italic>MYC</italic> family gene amplification with the expression of key transcription factors or subtype conversion in our cohort (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig">7f</xref>).</p>
      <p id="Par24">We therefore proposed that the overall genomic make-up of the common ancestral clone is the main driver of the sensitivity of patients to first-line chemotherapy. <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic> alterations were universally part of the common ancestral clone, and we sought to further classify alterations in both genes according to their impact on the functionality of the encoded protein. We distinguished between missense mutations creating a full-length protein and other somatic alterations as probably ‘gene damaging’ due to either out-of-frame transcription, early termination or larger insertions or deletions impacting protein expression (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5a</xref>, Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">11</xref> and <xref rid="Sec9" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). When assessing clinical outcome as a function of the qualitative nature of all significant gene alterations, we thus identified a higher risk of relapse in patients with these ‘other gene-damaging’ alterations in <italic>TP53</italic> (**<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01; Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8a,b</xref>), which had similarly been observed in other lung cancers<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>.

      <p id="Par25">Because some key mutations were acquired throughout the course of treatment, we next proposed that co-alterations of relevant genes might also impact patient survival. We therefore performed regression models and found that co-alterations of <italic>CREBBP</italic>/<italic>EP300</italic>, <italic>TP73</italic> or <italic>FMN2</italic> increased the relative risk of disease recurrence in patients without <italic>TP53-</italic>damaging alterations, which remained significant when adjusting for clinical parameters (HR 2.74, 95% confidence interval 1.01–7.44, *<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05); a similar trend was observed in the independent patient cohort (Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5e,f</xref> and Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">9c–e</xref>). Furthermore, co-alterations of <italic>CREBBP</italic>/<italic>EP300</italic>, <italic>TP73</italic> or <italic>FMN2</italic> suggested epistasis (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig14" ref-type="fig">9f</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p id="Par26">Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the clinical phenomenon of the initial high sensitivity of SCLC to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy followed by rapid relapse. We show that effective chemotherapy leads to elimination of a rapidly growing, pseudo-clonal population of cancer cells that dominates the tumour at diagnosis, followed by expansion of a large number of subclones derived from the common ancestor. We identify the primary tumour as a site with ongoing evolutionary adaption: following treatment-induced evolutionary pressure, ancestral clones already present in the primary tumour emerge from the common ancestor and give rise to subclones shaping clinical relapse. Our study thus establishes a critical role for the genomic context of the common ancestor in drug resistance, and we uncover its genomic portrait that is largely confined to biallelic losses of <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>RB1</italic>. Gene-damaging alterations in <italic>TP53</italic> associate with a particularly chemotherapy-resistant state in patients with SCLC, which is in line with studies establishing a role of functionally distinct <italic>TP53</italic> alterations impacting the response to chemotherapy and clinical outcome in cancer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup>. However, patients with <italic>TP53</italic> missense mutations can suffer a similarly poor response if co-occurring alterations of <italic>TP73</italic>, <italic>CREBBP/EP300</italic> or <italic>FMN2</italic> complement the dysfunction of <italic>TP53</italic>. Of note, the high frequency of mutations in these genes in the advanced-stage population of this study corroborates our previous reports of an important role of <italic>TP73</italic>, <italic>CREBBP/EP300</italic> or <italic>FMN2</italic> in SCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. Furthermore, adding to our previous discovery of somatic rearrangements of <italic>TP73</italic> (ref. <sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>), we now report recurrent <italic>TP73</italic> hotspot mutations at highly conserved residues. Although it is known that genome ploidy contributes to tumour malignancy and inferior survival<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup>, we found that clonal mutations of <italic>CREBBP</italic>/<italic>EP300</italic> associated with acquired genome duplication cause relapse and thereby provide a clear genetic mechanism of drug resistance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. Finally we demonstrate that although <italic>MYC</italic> family genes play an important role in SCLC biology, amplification events were often not part of the founder clone, and, furthermore, no associations with selection pressure and drug resistance were identified. Thus, our data provide a core set of recurrently altered genes that have a particular impact on drug sensitivity and resistance in SCLC.</p>
      <p id="Par27">Recent studies have established an impact of the expression of lineage transcription factors on drug response<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. In this study we could not identify notable transcriptional subtype conversion or correlation of major subtypes with treatment response, but found a strong relationship of certain genome alterations with clinical outcome. Future studies focused on combining genome evolutionary processes with single-cell transcriptome data are therefore warranted to elucidate the interplay of genomic and transcriptional heterogeneity in SCLC.</p>
      <p id="Par28">New drugs are typically tested in the second or third line of treatment, almost always with limited efficacy. We speculate that this phenomenon may be due, at least partially, to the massive increase in clonal heterogeneity following first-line chemotherapy described herein. Subclonal diversity following treatment was largely attributable to clock-like mutational processes, thus indicating that subclones at clinical relapse had existed before therapy. Independent of the sensitivity to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy, we found that ancestral clones acquire platinum-induced DNA damage throughout first-line therapy and emerge at relapse, which is more pronounced after effective radiation. We similarly observed platinum-based genomic damage in patients relapsing following effective ICI. Although we could not determine genomic or molecular patterns associated with response to ICI in these patients, our data demonstrate that genomic damage from first-line chemotherapy can complicate the efficacy and duration of response to other treatments initiated in subsequent lines. Despite the overall short time window of clinical care, effective treatment—including radiation or successful immunotherapy—can accelerate the emergence of ancestral clones with platinum-induced genomic scars that subsequently cause relapse. Although we could not identify specific gene mutations associated with these mutational processes, our data warrant studies focused on the consequences of platinum-induced changes on genome integrity and maintenance.</p>
      <p id="Par29">Overall, our findings related to the most recent common ancestor also have clinical implications. First, it may be an attractive concept for the discovery of new therapies to focus on alterations specifically present in the common ancestor. These may also serve as markers to monitor response and resistance to treatment. Second, we consider effective first-line treatment to be critical also for subsequent lines of therapy, because of the sheer increase in clonal diversity that drives drug resistance. Third, drugs in development may still be efficacious when tested early in the first-line setting, without being affected by a clonally diverse relapse that complicates subsequent lines of treatment.</p>
      <p id="Par30">In summary, we uncover genomic alterations underlying poor response and rapid relapse, which put the most recent common ancestral clone at the centre of cancer genome evolution. Our study therefore emphasizes the need for future therapeutic strategies to be tailored to target the detrimental cellular component of the founder clone to improve the outcome of patients with SCLC.</p>

        <title>Human lung tumour specimens</title>
        <p id="Par31">This study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Cologne. We analysed 160 tumours and patient-matched blood samples from 65 patients with SCLC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>). The samples were collected from multiple collaborating hospitals and clinical facilities under institutional review board-approved protocols, and all patients provided written informed consent. For some patients the material was collected as part of an ongoing clinical trial (BIOLUMA, study no. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03083691">NCT03083691</ext-link>), and those patients received as second- or third-line treatment anti-PD-1 either alone or in combination with anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors. The course of treatment for all patients and information on all samples are detailed below and summarized in Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>.</p>
        <p id="Par32">All tumour samples were pathologically reviewed by at least two independent expert pathologists who inspected the histomorphology based on haematoxylin and eosin and immunohistochemical staining. All tumours were confirmed with SCLC histology; tumours from three patients were diagnosed with additional morphological components of LCNEC or adenocarcinoma (Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). All patient-matched, multiregional tumour and normal blood samples were confirmed as belonging to the same patient by short tandem repeat (STR) analysis conducted at the Institute of Legal Medicine at the University of Cologne, Germany, and further confirmed by genome sequencing data.</p>
        <p id="Par33">In the majority of cases we analysed at least two tumour samples per patient, which were acquired at either single or multiple timepoints throughout the clinical course of treatment (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). More than two tumour samples were acquired for 37% of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 24 of 65). For five patients we analysed tumour samples at three distinct time points (<italic>n</italic> = 5 of 65, 8%; Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Samples were acquired as biopsies and lung resections, and we additionally engrafted tumour tissue from fine-needle biopsies (<italic>n</italic> = 2, one pleural and one lymph node metastasis) and CTCs (<italic>n</italic> = 29 of 160, 18%) onto immune-compromised mice (NSG mice) to establish PDX (in total <italic>n</italic> = 31 of 160, 19%; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>); this approach allowed for enrichment of limited tumour material for in-depth genomic studies. Samples analysed as PDX are listed in Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref> and are highlighted in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>. As previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>, sampling a patient’s blood for CTCs provides a minimally invasive approach towards analysis of tumour cells under therapy, and xenotransplant models have been shown to recapitulate the genomic profiles of the patient’s tumour. Xenotransplant models were established following an approach previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>; tumour cells were engrafted subcutaneously into the flanks of 7–14-week-old NSG mice (male and female, NOD.Cg-Prkdcscid Il2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ; Jackson Laboratories), and tumours were harvested at a maximum volume of 1.5 mm<sup>3</sup>. Tumour histology was confirmed by pathological review, and STR profiling with patient-matched normal and tumour samples confirmed the identity of the engrafted patient-derived material. All animals were housed in a specific-pathogen-free facility under ambient temperature and humidity while maintaining a 12/12 h light/dark cycle. Animal experiments were approved by, and conducted in accordance with, the regulations of the local animal welfare authorities (State Agency for Nature, Environment and Consumer Protection of the State of North Rhine-Westphalia, nos. AZ: 84-02.04.2012.A281, 84-02.04.2015.A172 and 84-02.04.2018.A002).</p>
        <p id="Par34">Samples were categorized by location: we referred to the primary lung tumour and grouped metastatic sites as intrapulmonary metastases, including pulmonary and lung and mediastinal lymph node metastases; tumour sites grouped as extrapulmonary metastases include intrathoracic distant metastases of the pleura and extrathoracic distant metastases affecting abdominal sites, the brain or other less common metastatic sites (breast, skin, sternum), as well as CTCs propagated as CTC-derived xenotransplant models, which represent cells that spread to the bloodstream with the potential to seed distant metastases. In patients with highly metastatic disease we furthermore assessed whether, based on radiological images, tumour sites sampled throughout therapy were pre-existing at the time of first diagnosis or before treatment, and whether these sites were exposed to any given therapy (chemotherapy, radiation or immune checkpoint blockade). Furthermore, we assessed whether any samples were taken from a newly formed metastatic site which, according to radiological imaging, was not pre-existing at the time of first diagnosis or before any other treatment exposure. For CTC-derived models, because we had no information regarding whether the tumour site may have shed cells to the bloodstream, we classified any CTC-derived sample as tumour cells that may have been exposed to any given treatment.

        <title>Clinical characteristics</title>
        <p id="Par35">The clinical characteristics of the patients in our cohort are in line with those typically found in SCLC (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>, Extended Data Table <xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Median age at the time of first diagnosis was 64 years, and patients were predominantly male (<italic>n</italic> = 43 of 65, 66%) with a history of heavy smoking and a median number of 40 pack years (smoking history was known for 89% of patients, <italic>n</italic> = 58 of 65; the number of pack years was determined for 85% of patients, <italic>n</italic> = 55 of 65). For clinical correlations the following categories were defined: age groups of 65 years or more and under 65. Smoking status was classified as ‘current smoker’, ‘former smoker’ or ‘never smoker’.</p>
        <p id="Par36">The majority of the patients presented with a highly metastatic tumour classified as stages III and IV (<italic>n</italic> = 57 of 65, 88%; additional information on tumour, node and metastasis staging is provided in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Seven patients were diagnosed with limited-stage disease or with tumour stage I, II or IIIA, and were therefore amenable to surgical lung resection.</p>
        <p id="Par37">Although one patient declined further therapy, all other patients in our cohort received systemic treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The majority of patients were treated with a combination of cisplatin/carboplatin and etoposide (<italic>n</italic> = 61 of 65; 94%); with regard to recent changes in the treatment of SCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>, additional PD-L1 inhibition was administered to five of these patients. Due to the initial diagnosis with histological components of non-SCLC (adenocarcinoma or LCNEC), two patients were treated with cisplatin/carboplatin combined with vinorelbine (patients S02814 and S02917). Furthermore, one patient received only monotherapy with carboplatin. Throughout the course of treatment 72% of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 47 of 65) received additional radiation, mainly of the chest/lung/mediastinum (<italic>n</italic> = 35 or 47) or brain (<italic>n</italic> = 38 of 47); four patients underwent stereotactic surgery of brain metastases.</p>
        <p id="Par38">The clinical response to treatment was assessed by radiological imaging and classified as either complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD) or mixed response (PR/PD). The clinical response to systemic first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was analysed for <italic>n</italic> = 55 patients; these patients receiving treatment with only systemic chemotherapy and were therefore considered for subsequent correlations of genomic and molecular phenotypes with clinical response. Genomic and molecular correlations with clinical response to chemotherapy were not considered for <italic>n</italic> = 10 patients in our cohort, because these patients were either lost to follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 2), declined further treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or received a lung resection resulting in differences in the dynamics of disease progression (<italic>n</italic> = 7).</p>
        <p id="Par39">Of the 55 patients who received only first-line systemic platinum-based chemotherapy, 60% (<italic>n</italic> = 33 of 55) responded to treatment with PR (<italic>n</italic> = 32) or CR (<italic>n</italic> = 1), 9% had stable disease (<italic>n</italic> = 5 of 55), 11% showed mixed response (<italic>n</italic> = 6 of 55) and 20% (<italic>n</italic> = 11 of 55) experienced a progressive disease, of which three succumbed to the disease during first-line treatment. Following treatment, two patients experienced fatal sepsis (patient S02608 while receiving treatment and experiencing disease progression; and patient S02658 following completion of chemotherapy; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>); both patients were consequently censored when performing correlations with relapse-free survival, and the therapy response of patient S02608 was not evaluated. Median progression-free survival was 6.3 months. In addition we determined CTFI as an independent measure of sensitivity and duration of response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy; median CTFI was 88 days. Fifty-three per cent of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 28 of 53) either did not respond, relapsed or succumbed to the tumour disease within 90 days following completion of first-line chemotherapy (following the guidelines of NCCN)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>, and these patients were thus clinically classified as either chemorefractory or -resistant). Of the remaining patients who, based on NCCN guidelines, were considered as ‘platinum-sensitive’, 30% (<italic>n</italic> = 16 of 53) relapsed within 6 months following completion of chemotherapy and 17% were relapse-free for more than 6 months (<italic>n</italic> = 9 of 53). At relapse, 83% of patients (<italic>n</italic> = 44 of 53) received second-line systemic therapies that included treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors (<italic>n</italic> = 27) or other chemotherapeutics, including topotecan (<italic>n</italic> = 8), rechallenge with carboplatin and etoposide (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or combinations of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and vincristine (<italic>n</italic> = 7) (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">1</xref>). Following tumour progression, ten patients were amenable to additional lines of therapy including immune checkpoint inhibitors (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or chemotherapeutics (<italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>
        <p id="Par40">The analysis of multiregional and longitudinal tumour sites from 65 patients with SCLC focused on distinct clinical scenarios. For interpatient comparisons we focused on studies of tumour pairs (‘Analysis of clonal architecture from multiregional and longitudinal tumour samples’; Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref>). We focused on distinct clinical scenarios: (1) analysis of tumour samples from spatially distinct sites obtained from treatment-naive patients at the time of first diagnosis (<italic>n</italic> = 16); (2) analysis of temporally distinct tumour sites referring to samples acquired before treatment and during therapy, including those from patients undergoing neo-adjuvant treatment (<italic>n</italic> = 5); and (3) samples acquired before treatment and at relapse following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (that is, either following an initial response or disease progression despite treatment, <italic>n</italic> = 42). The analysis further focused on (4) spatially, but not temporally, separate tumours analysed solely at the time of relapse (<italic>n</italic> = 14), and (5) tumour sites acquired at the time of relapse from platinum-based therapy and following subsequent lines of treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (pre- and post-treatment with ICI, <italic>n</italic> = 7). We thus performed in total <italic>n</italic> = 84 paired analyses of tumour sites in 65 patients with SCLC (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>).</p>
        <p id="Par41">In addition we performed clinical correlations in an independent cohort of patients with SCLC, who all received first-line systemic treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy; we performed whole-exome sequencing of the tumour samples and identified key genome alterations (<italic>n</italic> = 64 patients; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">12</xref>). This cohort was analysed to validate findings described in Fig. <xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5b</xref>; at least 56 samples are required to validate the findings at a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%; thus, we validated our findings at a power of greater than 80%.</p>

Fresh-frozen samples were processed by preparation of tissue sections, each of 20 μm thickness, on a cryostat (Leica) while maintaining a temperature of −20 °C. In the case of FFPE samples, sections of 20 μm thickness were prepared on slides on a microtome.

        <p id="Par44">For samples with limited tumour material we further adjusted protocols, which included repeated rounds of protein and nucleic acid precipitation, to increase the DNA yield for subsequent sequencing studies. All DNA isolates were hydrated in TE buffer and molecular weight was assessed using the Agilent TapeStation system (Genomic DNA ScreenTape no. 5067-5365, Agilent Technologies). DNA isolates from fresh-frozen samples were confirmed as being of high molecular weight (above 10 kb), and samples with evident signs of degradation were excluded from further sequencing studies.</p>

          <title>Dideoxynucleotide sequencing for validation of somatic alterations</title>
          <p id="Par50">If available, transcriptome or additional genome sequencing data were used to validate somatic mutations determined by genome sequencing. In cases without additional sequencing data, dideoxynucleotide chain termination sequencing (Sanger sequencing) was performed to validate key mutations, genomic rearrangements and chimeric fusion transcripts. Specifically, shared clonal mutations of key mutated genome alterations were confirmed by Sanger sequencing as being present in all tumour samples from a patient. For genomic rearrangements determined by WGS in a subset of samples per patient (Supplementary Tables <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>), PCR reactions were performed and the genomic breakpoint was probed and analysed in that subset of samples. Complex genome alterations affecting <italic>TP53</italic>, <italic>RB1</italic> and <italic>TP73</italic> were thus confirmed in all samples of the respective patient (annotation provided in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Clonal assessment of genomic rearrangement affecting key genes was determined with SVclone<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref></sup> (see below). For subclonal and private mutations of key gene alterations, Sanger sequencing was performed to confirm both the mutation call and absence of these alterations in matching tumour samples. Primer pairs were designed to amplify the target region encompassing the somatic alteration. PCR reactions were performed with either genomic DNA, whole-genome-amplified DNA or cDNA. Amplified products were subjected to Sanger sequencing and the respective electropherogram was analysed with Geneious v.8 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneious.com">www.geneious.com</ext-link>).</p>

In these cases, sequencing reads of all samples from a given patient (including the normal reference sample and tumour samples obtained directly from the patient and derived from murine xenotransplant models) were aligned to a combined human and murine reference genome (GRCh37/hg19 and GRCm38/mm10), to exclude sequencing reads from murine cells and to allow for uniform processing of all samples from a given patient. Concordant read-pairs were identified as potential PCR duplicates and were subsequently masked in the alignment file and annotated as the number of masked reads. The quality of the sequencing data is summarized in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>.</p>
        <p id="Par53">Human sequencing reads (mapped to the human reference genome) were analysed for tumour purity, tumour ploidy, somatic mutations and copy number alterations<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. In addition, WGS data were analysed for genomic rearrangements with the previously described analysis pipeline<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref></sup>. Mutation calling was performed as previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In brief, variant counts were assessed for tumour and matching normal samples, corrected for sequencing noise and compared with a database of 300 whole-exome and genome sequenced normal samples to filter and determine somatic mutation calls. Variants at low allelic fractions are often prone to result from sequencing artefacts, which occur as a consequence of sequencing noise arising from high-coverage WES due to either fragmented DNA as part of FFPE material or low-level contamination with murine reads in tumours derived from murine xenograft models. We therefore implemented strict filtering criteria for mutations occurring at allelic fractions of less than 0.2. Mutations were then filtered out if (1) the forward–reverse score was below 0.2 (forward–reverse score is 1.0 if 50% of variant reads are found on the forward or reverse read, and 0 if all variant reads are on one orientation); and (2) the allelic fraction of the variant <italic>v</italic> in consideration of minimal coverage <italic>C</italic> of the normal or matching tumour sample at position <italic>i</italic> (<italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><sup>min(tumour/normal)</sup>) did not exceed the read count (rc) threshold with a default value of 10. This was calculated as <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub><sup>min(tumour/normal)</sup> × <italic>v</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> &lt; rc. We thus introduced a decision boundary that filters out mutations at relatively low allelic fractions and low sequencing coverage; mutations with low allelic fractions but high coverage were retained for further analyses. In addition we adjusted the stringency of this cut-off for individual samples. Although this stringent cut-off limits the identification of subclonal mutations, we have thus controlled for potential sequencing noise and false-positive mutation calls. As described below, multiregional studies may suggest mutations at very low allele fractions in one tumour that might be more abundant at another tumour site. In this instance, truly subclonal mutations at low allelic fractions that were filtered out in one sample at this step of the analysis were reintroduced as somatic mutation calls if the same mutation passed all stringent filtering criteria in another matched tumour sample.</p>

        <title>Analysis of clonal architecture from multiregional and longitudinal tumour samples</title>
        <p id="Par54">We have developed a computational approach to identify individual clones from tumour sequencing data by applying a model that assigns an expected allelic fraction to each mutation under the assumption of clonality (that is, all tumour cells carry this mutation). The expected allelic fraction is corrected for tumour purity, average tumour ploidy and copy number state at the respective genomic coordinates of the said mutation. Relating the observed to the expected allelic fraction results in an estimated CCF that is a specific metric pertinent to each mutation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Subsequent clustering of CCFs enabled identification of cell clones represented by subsets of individual mutations. The CCFs and associated clones present in a given tumour thus define the overall clonal composition at the time point of sampling. Through a one-dimensional approach to CCF clustering, we determined for each single tumour its clonal composition (one-dimensional mutation clustering<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>), a method benchmarked in pan-cancer studies for tumour heterogeneity<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>.</p>
        <p id="Par55">To study tumour evolution from multiregional or longitudinal tumour samples from a given patient, we further developed a two-dimensional approach to analysing pairs of samples from the same patient (two-dimensional clustering) and thus to the reconstruction of clonal dynamics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup> (manuscript in preparation). Information on tumour phylogenies, subclonal mutations, subclones and clonal composition of sites is summarized in Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and detailed information is provided in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>. In addition, tumour phylogenies determined for each patient are provided in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec30">Supplementary Appendix</xref>.</p>
        <p id="Par56">The sequencing data of tumour samples in our cohort showed an average purity of 85% (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">3</xref>). Thus WES at an average coverage of 127× provided the required sequencing depth to determine subclones in our data. The analysis of tumour subclones focused on mutation calls as determined by exome sequencing in each sample to track individual tumour clones.</p>
        <p id="Par57">The computational method for tumour phylogeny reconstruction starts by executing an extensive set of comparisons and quality controls of copy number states, and a set of mutations and their respective CCFs for each sample. Rather than working with mutation calls and copy number states assessed individually for each tumour sample, we first performed comparisons and adjustments across all samples of a given patient. This included generating a unified copy number segmentation for all samples, which is critical for assigning within each chromosomal segment allele-specific mutation calls, and subsequently to compute CCFs for each mutation. We furthermore created for each patient a unified list of all somatic single-nucleotide mutations (SNMs) determined from each sample, and in all samples we reprobed the presence of somatic mutations of the unified list with relaxed filter criteria for calling somatic mutations at low allelic fractions from sequencing data. This approach allowed us to confirm whether high-confidence mutation calls from one sample were either private events or also present in other patient-matched samples but occurring at lower allelic fractions. Following the refined assessment of copy number states and somatic mutation calls, we determined for each mutation both the observed and expected allele frequency under the assumption of clonality (that is, a cancer cell fraction of 1), so that the CCF of the mutation can be calculated as the ratio between observed and expected allele frequency<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. We applied additional filter criteria to mark somatic mutations calls occurring near telomers (that is, located in the tails determined by 1.5% of chromosome length) or centromeric regions on the chromosome, where copy number estimations are frequently error prone and therefore lead to a potentially incorrect calculation of CCF.</p>
        <p id="Par58">Somatic insertions and deletions (indel calls) can lead to additional false-positive calls of SNMs as a consequence of improper mapping of reads with inserted or deleted bases. To reduce the number of false-positive SNM calls resulting from indels, we filtered out all SNMs in close proximity (less than 10 bp away) to any mutation call for insertions and deletions.</p>
        <p id="Par59">We applied filtering criteria for mutation calls present on chromosomal areas and which, in multiregional analyses, were found to undergo loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in at least one, but not all, of the samples of a given patient<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup>. Samples with LOH may not harbour certain mutational calls due to the LOH event, whereas patient-matched samples without LOH may show those mutations. Consequently observed private, or almost private (CCF &lt; 0.2), mutations in one sample lacking LOH events (whereas other patient-matched samples show the LOH event) may indicate a shared clone that undergoes copy number losses, and argue against the subclonal private acquisition of these mutations in this chromosomal area. A clear phylogenetic reconstruction in these cases is not straightforward: due to the inherent uncertainty if the mutations were not present in the other sample (that is, truly private) or lost via the LOH event, these mutations were excluded from phylogenetic tumour clone reconstructions. Following the same criteria, mutations in areas with subclonal copy number events in which one of the copy number clones was hit by an LOH event were also filtered out to avoid further uncertainty in the reconstruction of tumour phylogenies. As previously described<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>, our method also considered subclonal copy number changes in single-tumour samples. In consideration of copy number status and the observed allele frequency, the number of mutated copies was estimated and the CCF of the mutation determined. Somatic mutations that were found as clonal and that were the subject of subclonal copy number changes within single samples were filtered out.</p>
        <p id="Par60">In addition, we used the mapping qualities of the aligner (bwa mem, v.0.7.13-r1126) to filter out mutations in regions where more than 10% of uniquely mapped reads had a mapping quality below 10 (that is, less than 90% probability of having identified the correct mapping position).</p>
        <p id="Par61">With regard to potentially shared mutations, we also performed a power analysis to compare the CCFs of a given mutation between two samples with regard to their sequencing depth: we calculated a score per sample to consider the contribution of a single mutated read to the CCF. Per sample, the distribution of these scores could be estimated by a log-normal distribution whose 2.5% tails (<italic>z</italic>-score = 1.96) were cut off to filter out subsets of over- and underpowered mutations.</p>
        <p id="Par62">Last, to check further whether mutations observed as being private to one of the samples were truly private or simply not detected in the other sample (for example, due to insufficient coverage), we applied this statistical test: under the null hypothesis, the mutation is shared with an allelic fraction at least as high as that observed in one of the samples, and the probability (<italic>P</italic> value) of not detecting it within the given number of sequencing reads can be estimated using a binomial model. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the mutation is considered as being truly private, or otherwise is being filtered out. To determine those mutations that are rejected we apply the false discovery rate control at 5% by Benjamini–Hochberg correction.</p>
        <p id="Par63">Subsequent two-dimensional cluster analyses were performed with the set of mutations that passed all filters. This set was binned into a two-dimensional histogram of CCFs representing the observed data, which were modelled as a surface using two-dimensional smoothing splines with a common smoothing parameter. Based on an error estimate of the samples’ CCFs, this method deconvolutes part of the sequencing noise from the data. Subsequently the peaks of the surface were identified and interpreted as cluster centres (marked as red triangles in the cluster images for each patient; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec30">Supplementary Appendix</xref>), and all mutations were assigned to their nearest cluster centre by Euclidean distance. During the assignment procedure we require that shared mutations are assigned only to shared clusters whereas private mutations (that is, those exclusively called in one of the two samples) are assigned only to private clusters. Moreover, we set a minimum threshold of four mutations per cluster and disregarded identified surface peaks otherwise. Considering the cluster centre’s CCF as being representative of the corresponding cell clone, we applied the infinite sites hypothesis assuming that mutations appear once in the evolutionary history, and then determined the CCF sum rule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref></sup> to infer the most probable phylogenetic tree and, in particular, clonal composition per sample at the time point when sampling was derived. In the rare event that tumour phylogenetic rules allow for multiple solutions of tumour phylogeny, we assume maximum parsimony and prefer linear evolution over branched evolution within one sample.</p>
        <p id="Par64">In the case of CCF clusters that conflicted with phylogenetic rules we reanalysed somatic mutation calls initially computed with expected allele frequencies under the assumption of clonality. However, chromosomal segments with polyploidy allow for multiple values of absolute numbers of mutated copies (the so-called mutation multiplicity of each mutation call<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref></sup>). We therefore accounted for all potential solutions for mutation multiplicity of a given somatic mutation call and computed CCFs that rejected the assumption of clonality (null hypothesis) within the sample and which, in subsequent paired two-dimensional cluster analyses, resolved conflicts in phylogenetic tumour clone reconstruction.</p>

        <title>Analysis of tumour phylogenies</title>
        <p id="Par65">Our approach thus enabled us to assign tumour phylogenies for all 65 patients, and to track individual clones from multiregional and longitudinal data. We assigned mutations to the most recent common ancestor (C0) if they were shared and found to be clonal across all tumour sites sampled (that is, having CCFs of approximately 1.0). Alterations with lower CCFs, or those found to be private to single-tumour sites, were determined as subclones. Clusters of at least <italic>n</italic> = 5 subclonal mutations were defined and labelled as subclone C1, C2 or C3, and derivates of these subclones were assigned accordingly (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>). The resulting tumour phylogenies for all 65 patients are provided in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="Sec30">Supplementary Appendix</xref>, detailing all spatially and temporally distinct sites analysed and depicting the clinical treatment history for each patient. Additional information is provided in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>.</p>
        <p id="Par66">To study patterns of tumour evolution we assigned tumour phylogenetic trees to the following classes (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>): class A if no subclones were identified; class B if one subclone was identified, allowing only for linear evolvement of this subclone; class B if at least two subclones were found with linear phylogenies; class D, phylogenies with one branching event from C1 subclones; class E, phylogenies with one branching event from the most recent common ancestor clone C0; and class F, tumour phylogenies showing two or more branching events.</p>
        <p id="Par67">In this regard, increasing the number of tumour samples per patient will enhance the ability to determine subclonal mutations and subclones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Because we analysed various numbers of samples for each patient (in 37% of cases, more than two samples per patient) we additionally downscaled our analyses to only two samples per patient to permit interpatient comparisons (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2d</xref>); we thus performed a total of <italic>n</italic> = 84 paired analyses (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1c</xref> and Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). In the paired analysis for each patient we chose as representative the analysis showing the highest level of subclonal complexity, defined by the number of subclones and subclonal mutations identified. Downscaling the number of tumour samples per patient did not show any significant change in the absolute number of subclonal mutations but led to reduced numbers of assigned subclones with phylogenetic complexity of classes A–E only (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig">1a,b</xref>). Downscaling the analysis to two samples per patient for interpatient comparison enabled the study of distinct scenarios throughout the clinical course of the patients (Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>).

        <title>Analysis of mutational signatures</title>
        <p id="Par69">We analysed our data for the activity of mutational signatures available in COSMIC, referring to SBS (COSMIC_v3.3_SBS_GRChr37_exome<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>).</p>
        <p id="Par70">Mutational signatures were analysed for the following categories: (1) the clonal proportion of all treatment-naive tumours, (2) the subclonal proportion of all treatment-naive tumours and (3) the subclonal proportion of all post-treatment tumours acquired following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3a</xref>). The analysis of treatment-naive tumours refers to all naive samples available in this cohort (<italic>n</italic> = 58); signatures assigned to post-treatment tumours included all patients who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (<italic>n</italic> = 45), and we further distinguished whether tumour sites were exposed to chemotherapy alone (<italic>n</italic> = 20) or were potentially exposed to additional ionizing radiation (<italic>n</italic> = 25; Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">2</xref>). Due to the high tumour mutational burden, signature assignments to clonal mutations were performed in cases with a median of over 300 mutations. To avoid overfitting and noise, assignments for subclonal mutations were performed only for cases with at least <italic>n</italic> &gt; 20 mutations.</p>
        <p id="Par71">To fit mutational signatures to our samples we applied SigProfilerAssignment (that is, Analyze.cosmic_fit function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>) to identify a representative subset of signatures. We initially fitted SBS mutational signatures to the mutation catalogue of each sample assigned to the categories. Selecting mutational signatures found in at least <italic>n</italic> = 5 cases, we thus identified the most prevalent subset of signatures in the clonal and subclonal proportions of treatment-naive and post-treatment tumours (SBS1, SBS2, SBS3, SBS4, SBS5, SBS13, SBS15, SBS16, SBS24, SBS29, SBS39, SBS40 and SBS92), to which all mutations were then fitted. Post-treatment samples additionally showed platinum-based signatures (SBS31 and SBS35), which were therefore included for the assignment of signatures for the subclonal proportion of post-treatment tumours. In addition we applied the in-house-developed computational tool CaMuS<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup> to confirm signature assignments. With CaMuS we first linearly fitted the COSMIC signatures to all mutations for each sample (including clonal and subclonal mutations) using a backward selection procedure. We next selected only those signatures that markedly reduced the cost of the model calculated over the whole dataset. Both tools generated similar results. The results of SigProfilerAssignment are provided in Fig. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and Extended Data Figs. <xref rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.

        <p id="Par72">To track the dynamic activity of mutational signatures in patient-matched tumour samples over the course of the disease, we specifically assigned the subset of signatures identified with SigProfilerAssignment to patient-matched clonal and subclonal mutations pre- and post-treatment, including SBS31 and SBS35 (both related to platinum chemotherapy treatment) for all assignments of signatures. We thus confirmed the presence of platinum-based signatures only in post-treatment subclonal mutations of tumour samples but not in the patient-matched treatment-naive clonal or subclonal proportion of the tumour. In addition we analysed tumour samples from a cohort of patients undergoing subsequent second- or third-line treatment with immune checkpoint inhibition (<italic>n</italic> = 7). Tumour samples acquired before treatment with ICI were analysed in the categories above (corresponding to samples acquired at the time of relapse following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy).

        <title>Analysis of significant mutations, copy number alterations and genome ploidy</title>
        <p id="Par74">To assess the relevance of key gene alterations in our cohort we referred to our previous study of significant gene alterations determined for 110 human SCLC samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">8</xref>). In addition we expanded this analysis to our present cohort of 65 patients. We determined the mutational landscape for each patient by creating the union of all mutations identified in multiple samples—this refers to the sum of mutually inclusive and private events (Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">6</xref>). We combined the data from our current cohort of 65 patients with mutational data for 110 human SCLC samples<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup> (<italic>n</italic> = 175 patients) and determined significant gene alterations at a significance threshold of <italic>Q</italic> &lt; 0.05 following our previously described method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. In brief, our approach estimates the background mutation rate for each gene and corrects for both synonymous mutations and the expression in human SCLC, referring to the transcriptional data of human SCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>. The analysis included genes with fragments per kilobase exon per million mapped reads values of over 1 in at least 50 samples. Furthermore we analysed the data for significant mutational hotspots and significant enrichment of gene-damaging mutations. Mutations that significantly cluster within a gene were determined at <italic>Q</italic> &lt; 0.05 (mutational hotspots). The analysis of gene-damaging mutations refers to (1) nonsense mutations resulting in early stop codons, (2) splice site mutations resulting in aberrant splicing, intron retention or in-frame losses of larger regions within the protein product and (3) frameshift mutations leading to early stop codons and thus resulting in greater changes in the gene and encoded transcript, presumably leading to either no protein product, to proteins with larger deletions within the protein structure or to truncated proteins. The enrichment of gene-damaging alterations was determined at <italic>Q</italic> &lt; 0.05. We focused our studies on genes recurrently mutated in at least 8% of cases (affecting at least <italic>n</italic> = 14 patients in the combined analysis of this cohort and the previous cohort<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>); this allowed us to perform interpatient comparisons and to study a sufficient number of cases in our present cohort of <italic>n</italic> = 65 patients. To complement our analytical approach we also used other computational tools to study significant gene alterations, including MutSig2CV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref></sup>, dNdSCV<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref></sup> and OncodriveFML<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref></sup>. In brief, MutSig2CV and dNdSCV were run using their default configuration; for OncodriveFML we used the ‘complement’ method for the signature and ‘amean’ as statistics. Taking into account different levels of stringency, all computational models showed a high degree of overlap. All relevant and significant gene alterations are listed in Supplementary Table <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">8</xref>. In addition we studied gene alterations previously reported for targeted sequencing data from larger cohorts of patients with SCLC<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>; we scored the frequency and significance level of reported alterations for the samples in our cohort.

        <title>Clinical correlations with chemotherapy relapse-free survival</title>
        <p id="Par78">We studied correlations of genomic subsets with relapse-free survival in patients receiving first-line systemic treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The analysis focused on the study of <italic>n</italic> = 55 patients for whom the clinical response to first-line platinum-based chemotherapy was determined. Ten patients from our cohort were not considered for this analysis because of either loss to follow-up (<italic>n</italic> = 2), declined further treatment and no longer in clinical care (<italic>n</italic> = 1) or received a lung resection resulting in longer disease-free survival and differences in the dynamics of disease progression (<italic>n</italic> = 7). We determined relapse-free survival by referring to CTFI, defined as the time between the end of chemotherapy and tumour recurrence, including for patients with disease progression resulting in death. Two patients in our cohort were reported with sepsis-related mortality and were censored in the analysis for recurrence-free survival, leaving a final total of <italic>n</italic> = 53 patients. All survival analyses were performed with SPSS. Survival distributions were plotted as Kaplan–Meier curves, with <italic>P</italic> values determined by log-rank test (Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig13" ref-type="fig">8a</xref>). Hazard ratios with a 95% confidence interval and <italic>P</italic> values were further derived from Cox proportional hazard models. We performed correlations with key genomic parameters referring to significant gene mutations identified in Extended Data Fig. <xref rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and, in addition, we stratified patients according to genome ploidy (information available for <italic>n</italic> = 53 patients). We included in our analysis as clinical characteristics information on sex, age and tumour stage. We performed additional analyses on both smoking status and pack years of patients (available for <italic>n</italic> = 50 and <italic>n</italic> = 47 patients, respectively). Furthermore we included in our analyses the gene expression of key lineage transcription factors <italic>ASCL1</italic>, <italic>NEUROD1</italic> and <italic>POU2F3</italic> (available for <italic>n</italic> = 45 patients).</p>
        <p id="Par79">We checked that the assumption of proportional hazards was provided by log-minus-log survival plots and by the addition of time-dependent covariates to models. We performed multicollinearity assessment of predictors. We identified relevant gene alterations by performing regressions with backward elimination of insignificant predictors (backwards Wald, at a retention threshold of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05). The results of the Cox proportional hazard model are shown as forest plots.</p>
        <p id="Par80">Clinical correlations of genomic alterations with relapse-free survival were additionally analysed in an independent cohort of patients with SCLC (<italic>n</italic> = 64) who all received first-line systemic treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy.
