E.W.S. and S.D. performed the exome and whole-genome sequencing, RNA-seq and copy-number analysis. Z.M. and Y.G. performed validation of the fusions. Z.M. managed exome capture. J.T.P., E.A.B., S.C., V.J., B.S.J., W.Y. and C.P. performed biological validated studies. J. Shin, D.D.P., P.B.I. and M.V.-G. performed SOX2 IHC and FISH studies. K.E.H., A.F.G. and J.D.M. provided reagents and analysis support. J. Stinson, C.K.F., D.B., C.S.R. and J.G. collected sequencing data and performed mutation validation. F.G. and Z.Z. predicted the functional effects of mutations. E.W.S., P.M.H., R.B., T.D.W. and R.G. provided bioinformatics support, including the algorithm for variant calling, fusion detection and copy-number calling. R.B. and P.M.H. analyzed SNP array data. H.K., H.M.S., P.B.I., M.V.B. and A.F.G. provided pathology support. F.J.d.S., D.S.S., R.L.Y. and J.D.M. provided critical analysis and organizational support.
