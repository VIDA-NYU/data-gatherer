Scale bar = 100 \u03bcM. b, Expression of NCAM and TTF1 in patient biopsy by staff pathologist review of diagnostic sample matches CDXs. c, Presence of parenchymal brain metastasis, confirmed by staff neuroradiologist and treating physician review, in the cerebellum (indicated by dashed circle) of the patient from which MDA-SC39 was derived. d, Genomic alterations in CDXs. Top panel: mutation load; middle panel: somatic mutations and genomic gain/loss status; lower panel: type of base-pair substitution. e, Mutational status of common SCLC genes and others unique to each CDX are maintained over multiple CDX passages in three separate models. f, Expression heatmap for ASCL1- and NEUROD1-associated genes. g, CDX and PDX models derived from patient SC49 exhibit similar patterns of expression for common SCLC markers, including loss of TTF1 expression. These experiments were repeated in three independent tumors from each model. Scale bar = 100 \u03bcM.\nExtended Data Figure 2.\nOpen in a new tab\nITH among SCLC molecular subtypes. a, t-SNE visualization of NE gene expression status in all CDXs (n=2,000 cells each). b, t-SNE visualization of cell populations from biological replicates of MDA-SC39s and MDA-SC16r obtained from tumors grown in the same passage, but different mice. Note mixing of cell populations indicate that clustering is not due to variations in replicate (n=2,000 cells each). c, Heatmap analysis of NE gene expression indicating that all CDXs are considered high neuroendocrine subtypes. d, Expression of ASCL1 and NEUROD1 in all CDXs by both violin plot to indicate range in expression and feature plot to show abundance (n=2,000 cells each). e, Violin plots indicating expression of MYC family members in the CDXs (n=2,000 cells each). Each dot represents one cell and the violin curve represent the density of the cells at different expression levels. f, EMT score is elevated within MDA-SC39s and MDA-SC49r, which corresponds with increased expression of VIM and decreased EPCAM (n=2,000 cells each).\nExtended Data Figure 3.\nOpen in a new tab\nValidation of cluster calls and visualization. a, Silhouette analysis to determine cluster number in each of the eight CDXs. b, UMAP visualization of the clusters in all CDXs. c, Barplot of variations of absolute normalized enrichment scores (NES) for hallmark pathways in GSEA analysis in sensitive clusters (blue) and resistant clusters (red). The variation of pathway enrichment is higher in resistant clusters than sensitive clusters by one-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test (P-value=2.9e-6; n=21 pathways).\nExtended Data Figure 4.\nOpen in a new tab\nCDX copy number and expression of DNA repair genes between clusters. a,b, Inferred copy number between clusters in MDA-SC16r (a) and MDA-SC49r (b). c, Expression heatmap of genes associated with DNA repair in all CDX clusters. d, Violin plots indicating range of expression of several therapeutic targets within individual clusters. AURKA, AURKB and DLL3 were relatively unchanged between clusters. MDA-SC4s: n=978, 1022 cells for clusters 1\u20132; MDA-SC39s: n=1172, 828 cells for clusters 1\u20132; MDA-SC68s: n=733, 704, 563 cells for clusters 1\u20133; HCI-008s: n=596, 1,404 cells for clusters 1\u20132; MDA-SC49r: n=683, 317, 652, 348 cells for clusters 1\u20134.

Validation of CTC identification within a patient liquid biopsy by positive expression of epithelial, NE and SCLC genes.\nExtended Data Figure 6.\nOpen in a new tab\nEmergence of a mesenchymal cell cluster following cisplatin-treatment. Violin plot of VIM (a) and EXPCAM (b) expression in the clusters of MDA-SC68s vehicle and cisplatin-treated CDXs.
