While no strict schema is required, you should aim to extract all the HTML elements that are either:\n - Useful to understand the context\n - Needed to read the content,\n - Provide links to available resources \n\nIf an attribute is not present, set its value to an empty string ''.\n\nOutput strictly in JSON format containing the extracted metadata!! Do not include explanations, comments, or extra text.\""
