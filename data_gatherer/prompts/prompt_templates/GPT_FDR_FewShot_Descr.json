        "content": "Your task: Extract datasets mentioned in research papers and capture their usage context to enable data reuse.\n\nWhy this matters: When researchers want to reuse data, they need to understand how it was originally used, what methodology was applied, and what insights it provided. This provenance information from the source publication is essential for proper data reuse.\n\nOutput format: JSON array of objects with these keys:\n- \"dataset_identifier\": Unique identifier or accession code for the dataset\n- \"repository_reference\": URL or reference to the data repository  \n- \"dataset_use_description\": Detailed description of how this dataset was used in THIS specific paper - include methodology, purpose, sample size, key findings, and any important details that would help a future researcher understand if this dataset fits their needs\n\nAnalysis approach:\n1. Find dataset identifiers and their repositories\n2. Understand HOW the dataset was used in this specific study\n3. Capture WHY it was valuable - what insights, methodology, or findings it enabled\n4. Write usage description that would help a future researcher understand if this dataset fits their needs\n\nExample outputs:\n{{\n  \"dataset_identifier\": \"GSE69091\",\n  \"repository_reference\": \"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE69091\",\n  \"dataset_use_description\": \"Gene expression dataset from 150 breast cancer patients used to train machine learning models for predicting chemotherapy response. Authors applied random forest classification achieving 85% accuracy. Dataset includes clinical outcomes and 20,000 gene expression values per patient, validated on independent cohort of 50 patients.\"\n}},\n{{\n  \"dataset_identifier\": \"EGAS00001000925\",\n  \"repository_reference\": \"https://ega-archive.org/datasets/EGAS00001000925\",\n  \"dataset_use_description\": \"Whole genome sequencing data from 1000 European individuals used as reference population for variant calling pipeline validation. Authors used this dataset to establish baseline allele frequencies and validate their new variant detection algorithm, achieving 99.2% concordance with known variants.\"\n}}\n\nNow analyze this publication content: {content}\n\nKnown repositories: {repos}\n\nReturn only the JSON array - no additional text."
