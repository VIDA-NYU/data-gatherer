      "FANS allows separation and acquisition of nuclei from Glu and medial ganglionic (MGE)-derived GABA neurons (MGE-GABA) from autopsied cortical samples ( 17 , 19 ) ( Fig. 1 A ). MGE-GABA neurons comprise ∼60 to 70% of all neocortical GABA neurons and have been implicated in schizophrenia, major depression, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and epilepsy ( 30 , 31 ). We recently reported RNA-seq transcriptome profiling and ChIP-seq analysis of histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27ac) in Glu and MGE-GABA nuclei that were obtained from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) ( 19 ). H3K27ac is a robust marker of active promoters and enhancers ( 32 , 33 ). The DLPFC is the neocortical region that is important for cognition and executive function ( 1 ). To investigate regulatory changes across primate evolution, we performed H3K27ac ChIP-seq in Glu and MGE-GABA nuclei from four male chimpanzee and four rhesus macaque DLPFC, and integrated these datasets with our previously obtained data for humans ( 19 ) ( Dataset S1 ).\n",

      "We produced high-quality H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets ( Dataset S2 ), with biological replicates showing strong correlation in each cell type and species (all correlation coefficients, r > 0.8) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 A ). Well-established Glu markers (e.g., SLC17A7 , TBR1 ) were enriched in H3K27ac specifically in Glu neurons, whereas typical MGE-GABA markers (e.g., LHX6 , SOX6 ) were enriched in MGE-GABA neurons only ( Fig. 1 B – D and SI Appendix , Fig. S1 B – D ). We defined putative GREs as regions (peaks) of histone acetylation that were significantly enriched over the background in at least three of the four donors, detecting a comparable number of GREs (∼100,000) in at least one neuronal subtype in each species (hereafter, Glu or MGE-GABA GREs) ( Methods and Dataset S3 ). We then identified GREs that were differentially acetylated (DA) between neuronal subtypes in each species separately, focusing on the subset of GREs with the strongest cell type differences (fold change [FC] > 2, false-discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) ( Methods , SI Appendix , Fig. S1 E , and Dataset S4 ). We then subdivided GRE regions into proximal H3K27ac peaks (within 1 kb from annotated transcriptional start sites in the human genome), which are indicative of active promoters, and distal H3K27ac peaks, which are indicative of active enhancers. We confirmed the previously observed greater regulatory diversity of enhancers vs. promoters, detecting significant differential acetylation between cell types in 48 to 61% of enhancers vs. 12 to 17% of promoters ( Fig. 1 E ) ( 11 ). A substantial proportion of all active neuronal GREs (promoters and enhancers) was DA between Glu and MGE-GABA neurons (ranging from 43 to 56% in different species), with a comparable ratio of DA GREs between the neuronal subtypes in each species ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 E ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis using GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) ( 34 ) validated the cell type-specificity and functional relevance of the regulatory elements we identified ( Dataset S5 ).\n",

      "To test whether the cell-type–specific approach increases the sensitivity and resolution of GRE analysis, we compared the human Glu and MGE-GABA enhancers in the DLPFC with enhancers that were previously identified in bulk human tissues from several brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical regions) using H3K27ac ChIP-seq ( 12 , 35 ). Over 40% of non-DA enhancers but only ∼20% of either Glu or MGE-GABA DA enhancers had been previously identified in bulk cortex ( Fig. 1 F ). Despite a higher proportion of Glu vs. MGE-GABA neurons in the cortex, a comparable fraction of Glu DA and MGE-GABA DA enhancers was not detected in bulk cortical tissue. This is likely explained by the large number of unique subpopulations of cortical Glu neurons, which were recently uncovered in single-nucleus RNA-seq analyses ( 36 ). In contrast, the MGE-derived GABA neurons represent a less diverse subset of cortical neurons ( 36 ). Our approach also enables the assignment of neuron-subtype specificity for GREs that were previously detected in bulk brain tissues. For example, the human MYC enhancer that was previously found to be both human-specific and cortex-specific ( 12 ), is exclusively active in Glu but not in MGE-GABA neurons ( Fig. 1 G ).\n",

      "To enable the comparison of the H3K27ac datasets from different species, coordinates of Glu and MGE-GABA H3K27ac-enriched regions from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque were converted to the hg38 human genome assembly using liftOver ( 12 ) ( Methods ). Regions with overlapping coordinates were merged ( n = 110,270 for Glu; n = 91,560 for MGE-GABA), and liftOver was used again to convert the coordinates to panTro5 and rheMac8. Only GREs that could be mapped onto all three genomes and did not overlap blacklisted regions were included in the subsequent analyses (99,339 Glu and 82,761 MGE-GABA GREs) ( Methods and Dataset S6 ). We compared the H3K27ac signals within GREs between the species and neuronal subtypes using Pearson correlation, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) ( Methods , Fig. 1 H , and SI Appendix , Fig. S1 F and G ). Based on correlation and clustering analyses, we detected greater differences between cell types in each species compared with the differences between species in each cell type. Clustering and PCA showed a clear separation of samples into six groups according to cell type and species, with human and chimpanzee clustering closer together vs. rhesus macaque in each cell type.\n",

      "To investigate the regulatory changes during primate evolution, we analyzed H3K27ac levels within the GREs that were DA between species in each neuronal subtype in pairwise comparisons (i.e., species-enriched GREs) ( Methods , Fig. 1 I and J , SI Appendix , Fig. S1 H , and Dataset S7 ). In both Glu and MGE-GABA, ∼14 to 16% of promoters (2,146 in Glu and 1,754 in MGE-GABA) and ∼34 to 38% of enhancers (32,785 in Glu and 23,435 in MGE-GABA) were DA in human vs. rhesus macaque (FDR < 0.05, FC > 2) ( Fig. 1 J ). Consistent with the closer evolutionary relationship between human and chimpanzee, there were fewer DA promoters (896 in Glu and 609 in MGE-GABA) and enhancers (15,625 in Glu and 8,495 in MGE-GABA) between human and chimpanzee. Thus, using a cell-type–specific analysis, we showed that, in each neuronal subtype, ∼30% of the GREs underwent significant changes in primate evolution. Examples of such regulatory changes are shown in SI Appendix , Fig. S1 I .\n",

      "Previous work in bulk brain tissues has shown that evolutionary changes preferentially occur in GREs that are mainly active in a single brain region (cortex, midbrain, or cerebellum), but not in multiple structures ( 12 ). This result fits a model in which changes in GREs that are not region-specific are more likely to cause pleiotropic effects, which might be detrimental to the fitness of the organism and are, therefore, selected against during evolution. We hypothesized that this trend also extends to evolutionary changes in the activity of cell-type–enriched GREs. Only a limited number of GREs have changed between human and chimpanzee, precluding a reliable statistical analysis. We therefore assembled two sets of GREs that were detected in human and/or rhesus macaque in each neuronal subtype (93,222 for Glu and 79,181 for MGE-GABA), and compared cell-type specificity of DA and non-DA GREs between the two species ( Fig. 2 A ). We found that DA GREs were significantly more often cell type-specific than non-DA ones (Fisher’s exact test, P < 2.2e-16; odds ratios: 2.8 for Glu and 2.2 for MGE-GABA). Conversely, human GREs that were non-DA between neuronal subtypes were significantly less frequently DA between the two species compared to GREs that were DA between Glu and MGE-GABA (Fisher’s exact test, P < 2.2e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A ).\n",

      "To further validate this finding, we used a threshold-free approach by directly comparing the enrichment of enhancers in neuronal subtypes (e.g., difference between Glu and MGE-GABA in human, ΔCellType human = H3K27ac Glu,human − H3K27ac GABA,human ) vs. the evolutionary change (e.g., difference between human and macaque in Glu cells, ΔSpecies Glu = H3K27ac Glu,human − H3K27ac Glu,rhesus ) ( Methods ). This analysis used independent biological samples to estimate H3K27ac Glu,human at each step of the analysis, to avoid spurious correlations driven by noise in individual datasets. Across all enhancers detected in human Glu cells, we found a significant correlation between the cell type-specificity and the evolutionary change (Spearman r = 0.203, P < 1e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 B , Upper ). No such correlation was observed when the enhancers were randomly shuffled. A similar pattern was observed in human MGE-GABA cells ( r = 0.106, P < 1e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 B , Lower ). These analyses confirm that evolutionary divergence of neuronal enhancers preferentially occurs in a cell-type–specific manner.\n",

      "Whereas GREs active in both Glu and MGE-GABA (hereafter, pan-neuronal GREs) are more often evolutionarily conserved between human and rhesus macaque than cell-type–specific ones, a substantial proportion of pan-neuronal GREs change in at least one neuronal subtype ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A ). Thus, our data offered a unique opportunity to compare the evolution of enhancers that are active in at least two closely related cell types. We found that, among these shared enhancers ( n = 35,676) (dark purple in Fig. 2 B ), 19,225 (∼54%) showed no evolutionary changes (gray panel in Fig. 2 C ), whereas the rest ( n = 16,451) changed between the species in at least one cell type (DA analyses between human and rhesus macaque in Glu or MGE-GABA, FC > 2; FDR < 0.05) (yellow, orange, and purple panels in Fig. 2 C ). We then asked whether evolutionary changes in the latter group were similar in Glu vs. MGE-GABA neurons. We categorized the enhancers into 1) enhancers with the same direction of evolutionary change in both Glu and MGE-GABA neurons (orange panels in Fig. 2 C ), 2) enhancers with an evolutionary change in only one cell type (yellow panels in Fig. 2 C ), and 3) enhancers with evolutionary changes of opposite directions in Glu and MGE-GABA neurons. The latter group represents a small subset of enhancers that may be functionally respecified ( 12 , 37 ), with activity switching from one neuronal subtype in one species to a different neuronal subtype in another species (purple panels in Fig. 2 C ). We used a linear model to further assess the statistical significance of these evolutionary events, assigning events to several categories depending on the proportion of variance explained by the corresponding factor (η 2 ) and the FDR value ( Methods and SI Appendix , Fig. S2 C ). By overlapping the results of this analysis with the DA analysis ( Fig. 2 C ), we identified 3,074 enhancers that changed in the same direction in both cell types, 2,425 enhancers that changed in one but not in the other cell type, and 100 enhancers that underwent a respecification ( Fig. 2 D and Dataset S8 ).\n",

      "Examples of these three types of evolutionary events are highlighted in Fig. 2 E – G . The enhancer in the PTCH2 locus showed increased activity in human vs. rhesus macaque in both neuronal subtypes ( Fig. 2 E ). Another enhancer, located ∼60 kb upstream of the MEF2A promoter, illustrates an evolutionary change that occurred in only one cell type. The pan-neuronal activity of this enhancer in rhesus macaque is contrasted with strictly Glu-specific H3K27ac signal in human ( Fig. 2 F ). Finally, an enhancer in the POLQ locus provides a rare example of respecification, as it is Glu-specific in human and MGE-GABA–specific in rhesus macaque ( Fig. 2 G ). Altogether, these results indicate that enhancers in conserved genomic positions between species in the same tissue can undergo different evolutionary changes in different cell types. Therefore, positional conservation of an enhancer is not always a reliable proxy for its functional conservation, suggesting that variation of enhancer activity between cell types is most likely greater than can be inferred based on positional conservation alone.\n",

      "We next examined how the evolutionary changes in the regulatory landscape of the neuronal subtypes are reflected in changes in gene expression. We performed RNA-seq on FANS-separated Glu and MGE-GABA nuclei purified from the same DLPFC specimens that were used for the H3K27ac profiling ( Dataset S1 ), obtaining high-quality transcriptomes for each species and cell type ( Methods , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A – E , and Dataset S9 ). In agreement with previous findings in various bulk tissues and species ( 38 ), the expression of protein-coding genes ( n = 16,846) was much more conserved between species than the expression of long intergenic noncoding RNA genes ( n = 518) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 F ).\n",

      "Next, in each neuronal subtype, we identified DA GREs and differentially expressed (DE) genes that were enriched or depleted in a particular species compared to the two other species ( Fig. 3 A , Left and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 G , Upper ). We denoted these up-regulated or down-regulated GREs or genes as species-specific up- or down-DA GREs or DE genes. To focus on high-confidence DA GREs and DE genes, we applied conservative FC thresholds in both analyses (FC > 2, FDR < 0.05) ( Methods , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 G , Lower , and Datasets S10–S12 ). We found thousands of DA GREs and hundreds of DE genes for each comparison, with the largest numbers of species-specific GREs and genes detected in rhesus macaque ( Fig. 3 B and C ). The analysis of DE genes showed that approximately half of the genes that were species-specific in one neuronal subtype were also specific for the same species in another neuronal subtype ( Dataset S12 ). In addition, for both neuronal subtypes, the species-specific up-DE genes significantly overlapped with the up-DE genes that have been recently reported for the same species in sorted neuronal (NeuN + ) nuclei from the DLPFC (11 to 31% overlap for Glu DE genes and 12 to 23% overlap for MGE-GABA DE genes, P < 2.5e-6 by hypergeometric test) ( Dataset S13 ) ( 39 ). Also, our gene-expression data were in good agreement with the results of human vs. rhesus macaque DE analysis in bulk adult DLPFC reported by the PsychENCODE consortium (17 to 19% overlap, P < 2.8e-14 by hypergeometric test) ( Dataset S14 ) ( 40 ).\n",

The human-specific DE gene sets in Glu or MGE-GABA neurons were not enriched for genes from any functional GO categories; the chimpanzee-specific Glu DE genes were enriched for a few GO terms, including “axon development,” adjusted P = 0.014. ( Dataset S15 ). Species-specific GREs were enriched for gene sets from several GO terms; however, the majority of these terms were not related to the nervous system ( Dataset S15 ). One exception was the enrichment of the human-specific DA GREs in Glu neurons for the “regulation of glutamate secretion” term (adjusted P value 0.019). Also of interest were the results of GO analysis for the pairwise interspecies comparisons ( Dataset S15 ). In MGE-GABA neurons, the GREs that were up-regulated in human vs. rhesus macaque were significantly enriched for the “L-type voltage gated calcium channels” term as well as for genes involved in “Wnt-activated receptor activity.” The Wnt pathway-related genes (e.g., FZD8 ) are known to influence cortical size ( 42 , 43 ).\n",

      "We then linked species-specific GREs to nearby genes using GREAT ( Methods ) and overlapped the resulting gene sets with genes showing species-specific expression ( Fig. 3 A , Right , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 H , and Datasets S16 and S17 ). This analysis yielded hundreds of genes with evidence of concordant species-specific evolutionary changes in gene expression and in at least one associated GRE ( Fig. 3 D ). The fraction of species-specific DE genes that had a concordant DA GRE varied for each species and was in the range of 18 to 30% in human, 17 to 26% in chimpanzee, and 40 to 53% in rhesus macaque for up- or down-regulated DE genes in Glu or MGE-GABA ( Dataset S18 ). We used random shuffling ( Methods ) to assess statistical significance of the observed concordant association between GREs and genes. For all categories of concordant changes (species-specific up- or down-regulated, Glu or MGE-GABA neurons, promoters or enhancers), concordant GRE-gene pairs were significantly overrepresented compared with random pairs (all P s < 1e-7) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 I ), indicating that the genes linked to DA regulatory elements are more likely to be DE than expected by chance. Thus, a sizable proportion of the identified concordant GRE-gene pairs likely represents functional associations that underlie evolutionary differences in gene expression between the primate species, rather than resulting from coincidental colocalizations of species-specific DA peaks and DE genes.\n",

Separation of GREs into promoters and enhancers showed that the majority of genes with concordant evolutionary changes in expression and promoter signal also had an evolutionary change in at least one enhancer (70% in Glu and 64% in MGE-GABA) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 J ). Finally, in all three species, concordant genes often associated with multiple concordant enhancers (23 to 45% of human- or chimpanzee-specific and ∼60% of rhesus macaque-specific concordant up- or down-regulated DE genes in Glu or MGE-GABA) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 K ).\n",

      "Whereas changes in promoter signals were associated with larger changes in gene expression compared with changes in enhancers ( Fig. 3 E and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 L ), the neuronal regulatory landscapes often encompass more than one enhancer per gene ( 6 , 44 ). Therefore, we asked if additional quantitative features that represent aggregate measures of an entire gene regulatory domain (as defined by GREAT with the basal plus extension setting) ( Methods ), such as the number of DA regulatory elements per gene ( 45 ) or the intensity of an enhancer signal (maximum and sum), could provide independent validation of the functional evolutionary change in a concordant DA enhancer-gene pair. We found that, in both neuronal subtypes, each of these regulatory features significantly correlated with gene expression ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 M and N ) and that evolutionary changes in these features were significantly correlated with evolutionary changes in gene expression (Spearman correlation, all P s < 2.2e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 O and P ). Finally, we confirmed that the majority of the concordant enhancer-gene pairs represent genes with an evolutionary change not only in individual enhancer but also in the entire regulatory domain ( Fig. 3 F ). These gene sets, with their associated epigenetic features, are compiled in Dataset S19 , which provides a resource to enable future hypothesis-driven functional and evolutionary studies on primate brains.\n",

      "Two representative examples of human-specific concordant GRE-gene pairs are CAT and SLC17A8 loci ( Fig. 3 G – J ). CAT encodes the hydrogen peroxide-degrading enzyme catalase. CAT is more strongly expressed in Glu vs. MGE-GABA neurons and is preferentially expressed in hominids (i.e., humans and chimpanzees) vs. rhesus macaque, with a significantly higher expression in human vs. chimpanzee. In addition to the strong human-specific H3K27ac enrichment in the promoter, we also detected an enrichment in several Glu-specific CAT enhancers in human or chimpanzee vs. rhesus macaque. Accumulation of H 2 O 2 in oxidative metabolism has been linked to oxidative-stress–associated neurodegenerative disorders ( 46 ). Elevated expression of CAT in human neurons could, therefore, reflect the evolution of protective mechanisms that limit oxidative damage resulting from the higher metabolic activity of the human brain compared to that of chimpanzee ( 47 – 49 ). SLC17A8 encodes vesicular glutamate transporter 3 and is selectively up-regulated in human MGE-GABA neurons, with corresponding gains in human-specific enhancers. SLC17A8 is implicated in cocaine abuse ( 22 ) as well as in anxiety-related behaviors ( 50 ).\n",

Among them, ATP2C2 , which is linked to language impairment ( 54 ), is strongly expressed in Glu neurons specifically in human (five- or eightfold change vs. chimpanzee or rhesus macaque, adjusted P < 1.2e-5), which was concordant with changes in multiple regulatory features ( Dataset S19 ).

      "Whereas the other eight genes associated with language impairment did not show any concordant evolutionary changes in their regulation and expression, we detected many human-specific (and often cell type-specific) DA GREs that were linked to several of these genes ( Dataset S20 ). Human-specific enhancers were found in CNTNAP2 ( n = 8 in Glu, n = 6 in MGE-GABA) and FOXP2 ( n = 1 in Glu) loci ( Fig. 4 A and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 A and B ). These two genes have been suggested to be required for the proper development of speech and language in humans ( 24 – 26 ). The functional importance of these regulatory changes remains unclear, as we did not observe any significant human-specific changes in gene expression for FOXP2 or CNTNAP2 . Nevertheless, it appears plausible that the increase in regulatory complexity engenders context-dependent mechanisms of regulation of FOXP2 or CNTNAP2 expression in anatomical (including brain areas and subpopulations of Glu or MGE-GABA neurons), environmental, or developmental contexts, which could, in turn, facilitate the emergence of language skills. Notably, cortical areas other than the DLPFC, such as the inferior frontal cortex and temporal cortex, constitute the core of the brain language network ( 56 , 57 ). The evolutionary changes in regulation and expression of FOXP2 or CNTNAP2 in these cortical areas remain to be investigated.\n",

The enhancer (shown in a dashed box) is located within the second intron of CNTNAP2 and shows human-specific up-regulation of the H3K27ac signal in MGE-GABA neurons. Shown are: ASD-associated SNP rs7794745 (red arrow) ( 59 ), the region with the largest decrease in DNA methylation (DNAm) in Hu vs. Ch (green bar) ( 53 ), and the position of an H3K27ac peak (brown bar) that is up-regulated in ASD vs. control subjects ( 55 ).

      "A recent DNA methylation study in the PFC of human and chimpanzee identified four regions within the CNTNAP2 locus that were differentially methylated between the two hominids ( 58 ). Remarkably, the region with the largest decrease in DNA methylation in human vs. chimpanzee (region B in that study) overlapped with one of the MGE-GABA– and human-specific up-regulated enhancers detected in our study ( Fig. 4 A ). In addition, an ASD-linked SNP, rs7794745 ( 59 ), which is located ∼280 bp from differentially methylated region B, colocalizes with the same CNTNAP2 enhancer ( Fig. 4 A ). The major allele nucleotide of rs7794745 (A > T) is a human-specific substitution compared to other primate species ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 C ). This enhancer was also identified and found to be up-regulated in ASD in a recent H3K27ac study in bulk brain tissues, including the PFC ( Fig. 4 A ) ( 60 ).

      "We found contiguous genomic regions with a high density of human-specific up-regulated GREs, which suggested a nonuniform distribution of these GREs across the genome. This trend is exemplified by an ∼1-Mb-long genomic region upstream of CDH8 on chromosome 16 that contains a cluster of 11 human-specific up-DA GREs in Glu neurons ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 D ). Applying stringent statistical analysis ( Methods ), we identified a significant enrichment of human up-DA GREs over the background distribution of all human GREs in 23 clusters, with 18 and 5 nonoverlapping clusters detected in Glu and MGE-GABA neurons, respectively ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 E ). Four Glu clusters contained a human-specific DE gene ( OPRM1 , GULP1 , NIT2 , PKDCC ). Several genes with important roles in the nervous system or neuropsychiatric disorders overlapped with the human up-DA GRE clusters. In particular, CDH8 encodes a neurite outgrowth-regulating membrane protein cadherin-8 and has been linked to ASD and learning disability ( 27 ). Similarly, ASTN2 is located within a Glu cluster on chromosome 9 and has been associated with ASD ( 29 ). Among the 76 genes located at Glu-neuronal DA clusters, 9 are associated with ASD according to the SFARI database ( https://www.sfari.org/resource/sfari-gene/ ) ( 61 ), which is a significant enrichment ( P = 0.02 by hypergeometric distribution). Notably, recent publications suggest that human-specific evolutionary changes in gene regulation and expression could be associated with risk for ASD ( 14 , 62 ). A previously described class of human genomic regions that harbor signatures of human-specific evolutionary changes consists of human-accelerated regions (HARs) ( 63 ). Three of the 18 Glu clusters overlapped with HARs (HAR2, HAR22, HAR47; Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.005), and each of these 3 HARs overlapped with a human Glu enhancer identified in our study.\n",

      "We were particularly interested in the cluster containing OPRM1 , a gene that encodes a receptor of endogenous opioid peptides and is implicated in opioid addiction ( Fig. 4 B – E ) ( 20 , 21 ). OPRM1 is expressed in the PFC, and μ-opioid receptor signaling in the PFC is implicated in altering executive control and motivational functions, which are important in drug addiction ( 64 ). The OPRM1 locus overlaps with one of the Glu clusters on chromosome 6 that contains 17 human- and Glu-specific up-DA enhancers, as well as a human- and Glu-specific up-DA promoter ( Fig. 4 B ). Concordant with these regulatory changes, OPRM1 expression is up-regulated in humans compared with the two primate species in Glu but not in MGE-GABA neurons ( Fig. 4 E ). We also found that two human-specific up-DA GREs within OPRM1 harbor risk SNPs associated with opioid addiction ( rs1799971 and rs3778150 ), which are situated within the OPRM1 promoter and one of its enhancers, respectively ( 65 , 66 ) ( Fig. 4 C ). Strikingly, the major allele nucleotide of rs3778150 (T > C) is a strictly human-specific substitution within a region that otherwise shows high sequence conservation across mammals ( Fig. 4 D ). The OPRM1 regulatory domain also provides an example of a respecification event, as it contains an enhancer that is active in Glu neurons in human but in MGE-GABA neurons in rhesus macaque ( Fig. 4 B ). Thus, the OPRM1 locus shows strong evidence of extensive evolutionary changes of its regulatory landscape that are coupled with concordant changes in gene expression specific to Glu neurons. In addition to OPRM1 , two other genes implicated in drug abuse, SLC17A8 (discussed above) ( Fig. 3 J ) and PENK ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 F and G ), showed concordant evolutionary changes in gene expression and regulation. In contrast to OPRM1 , the changes in these two genes were specific to MGE-GABA neurons. Notably, among the eight genes that comprise the family of opioid ligands and receptors ( OPRM1 , OPRD1 , OPRK1 , OPRL1 , POMC , PENK , PDYN , PNOC ), we detected two concordant human-up-regulated DE genes ( OPRM1 and PENK ) (enrichment P = 0.01 by hypergeometric test). In summary, our findings suggest human-specific modification of cellular and molecular pathways implicated in drug addiction.\n",

      "We produced high-quality H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets ( Dataset S2 ), with biological replicates showing strong correlation in each cell type and species (all correlation coefficients, r > 0.8) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 A ). Well-established Glu markers (e.g., SLC17A7 , TBR1 ) were enriched in H3K27ac specifically in Glu neurons, whereas typical MGE-GABA markers (e.g., LHX6 , SOX6 ) were enriched in MGE-GABA neurons only ( Fig. 1 B – D and SI Appendix , Fig. S1 B – D ). We defined putative GREs as regions (peaks) of histone acetylation that were significantly enriched over the background in at least three of the four donors, detecting a comparable number of GREs (∼100,000) in at least one neuronal subtype in each species (hereafter, Glu or MGE-GABA GREs) ( Methods and Dataset S3 ). We then identified GREs that were differentially acetylated (DA) between neuronal subtypes in each species separately, focusing on the subset of GREs with the strongest cell type differences (fold change [FC] > 2, false-discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05) ( Methods , SI Appendix , Fig. S1 E , and Dataset S4 ). We then subdivided GRE regions into proximal H3K27ac peaks (within 1 kb from annotated transcriptional start sites in the human genome), which are indicative of active promoters, and distal H3K27ac peaks, which are indicative of active enhancers. We confirmed the previously observed greater regulatory diversity of enhancers vs. promoters, detecting significant differential acetylation between cell types in 48 to 61% of enhancers vs. 12 to 17% of promoters ( Fig. 1 E ) ( 11 ). A substantial proportion of all active neuronal GREs (promoters and enhancers) was DA between Glu and MGE-GABA neurons (ranging from 43 to 56% in different species), with a comparable ratio of DA GREs between the neuronal subtypes in each species ( SI Appendix , Fig. S1 E ).

      "To test whether the cell-type–specific approach increases the sensitivity and resolution of GRE analysis, we compared the human Glu and MGE-GABA enhancers in the DLPFC with enhancers that were previously identified in bulk human tissues from several brain regions (cortex, cerebellum, and subcortical regions) using H3K27ac ChIP-seq ( 12 , 35 ). Over 40% of non-DA enhancers but only ∼20% of either Glu or MGE-GABA DA enhancers had been previously identified in bulk cortex ( Fig. 1 F ). Despite a higher proportion of Glu vs. MGE-GABA neurons in the cortex, a comparable fraction of Glu DA and MGE-GABA DA enhancers was not detected in bulk cortical tissue. This is likely explained by the large number of unique subpopulations of cortical Glu neurons, which were recently uncovered in single-nucleus RNA-seq analyses ( 36 ). In contrast, the MGE-derived GABA neurons represent a less diverse subset of cortical neurons ( 36 ). Our approach also enables the assignment of neuron-subtype specificity for GREs that were previously detected in bulk brain tissues. For example, the human MYC enhancer that was previously found to be both human-specific and cortex-specific ( 12 ), is exclusively active in Glu but not in MGE-GABA neurons ( Fig. 1 G ).\n",

      "To enable the comparison of the H3K27ac datasets from different species, coordinates of Glu and MGE-GABA H3K27ac-enriched regions from chimpanzee and rhesus macaque were converted to the hg38 human genome assembly using liftOver ( 12 ) ( Methods ). Regions with overlapping coordinates were merged ( n = 110,270 for Glu; n = 91,560 for MGE-GABA), and liftOver was used again to convert the coordinates to panTro5 and rheMac8. Only GREs that could be mapped onto all three genomes and did not overlap blacklisted regions were included in the subsequent analyses (99,339 Glu and 82,761 MGE-GABA GREs) ( Methods and Dataset S6 ). We compared the H3K27ac signals within GREs between the species and neuronal subtypes using Pearson correlation, hierarchical clustering, and principal component analysis (PCA) ( Methods , Fig. 1 H , and SI Appendix , Fig. S1 F and G ). Based on correlation and clustering analyses, we detected greater differences between cell types in each species compared with the differences between species in each cell type. Clustering and PCA showed a clear separation of samples into six groups according to cell type and species, with human and chimpanzee clustering closer together vs. rhesus macaque in each cell type.\n",

      "To investigate the regulatory changes during primate evolution, we analyzed H3K27ac levels within the GREs that were DA between species in each neuronal subtype in pairwise comparisons (i.e., species-enriched GREs) ( Methods , Fig. 1 I and J , SI Appendix , Fig. S1 H , and Dataset S7 ). In both Glu and MGE-GABA, ∼14 to 16% of promoters (2,146 in Glu and 1,754 in MGE-GABA) and ∼34 to 38% of enhancers (32,785 in Glu and 23,435 in MGE-GABA) were DA in human vs. rhesus macaque (FDR < 0.05, FC > 2) ( Fig. 1 J ). Consistent with the closer evolutionary relationship between human and chimpanzee, there were fewer DA promoters (896 in Glu and 609 in MGE-GABA) and enhancers (15,625 in Glu and 8,495 in MGE-GABA) between human and chimpanzee. Thus, using a cell-type–specific analysis, we showed that, in each neuronal subtype, ∼30% of the GREs underwent significant changes in primate evolution. Examples of such regulatory changes are shown in SI Appendix , Fig. S1 I .\n",

      "Previous work in bulk brain tissues has shown that evolutionary changes preferentially occur in GREs that are mainly active in a single brain region (cortex, midbrain, or cerebellum), but not in multiple structures ( 12 ). This result fits a model in which changes in GREs that are not region-specific are more likely to cause pleiotropic effects, which might be detrimental to the fitness of the organism and are, therefore, selected against during evolution. We hypothesized that this trend also extends to evolutionary changes in the activity of cell-type–enriched GREs. Only a limited number of GREs have changed between human and chimpanzee, precluding a reliable statistical analysis. We therefore assembled two sets of GREs that were detected in human and/or rhesus macaque in each neuronal subtype (93,222 for Glu and 79,181 for MGE-GABA), and compared cell-type specificity of DA and non-DA GREs between the two species ( Fig. 2 A ). We found that DA GREs were significantly more often cell type-specific than non-DA ones (Fisher’s exact test, P < 2.2e-16; odds ratios: 2.8 for Glu and 2.2 for MGE-GABA). Conversely, human GREs that were non-DA between neuronal subtypes were significantly less frequently DA between the two species compared to GREs that were DA between Glu and MGE-GABA (Fisher’s exact test, P < 2.2e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A ).\n",

      "To further validate this finding, we used a threshold-free approach by directly comparing the enrichment of enhancers in neuronal subtypes (e.g., difference between Glu and MGE-GABA in human, ΔCellType human = H3K27ac Glu,human − H3K27ac GABA,human ) vs. the evolutionary change (e.g., difference between human and macaque in Glu cells, ΔSpecies Glu = H3K27ac Glu,human − H3K27ac Glu,rhesus ) ( Methods ). This analysis used independent biological samples to estimate H3K27ac Glu,human at each step of the analysis, to avoid spurious correlations driven by noise in individual datasets. Across all enhancers detected in human Glu cells, we found a significant correlation between the cell type-specificity and the evolutionary change (Spearman r = 0.203, P < 1e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 B , Upper ). No such correlation was observed when the enhancers were randomly shuffled. A similar pattern was observed in human MGE-GABA cells ( r = 0.106, P < 1e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 B , Lower ). These analyses confirm that evolutionary divergence of neuronal enhancers preferentially occurs in a cell-type–specific manner.\n",

      "Whereas GREs active in both Glu and MGE-GABA (hereafter, pan-neuronal GREs) are more often evolutionarily conserved between human and rhesus macaque than cell-type–specific ones, a substantial proportion of pan-neuronal GREs change in at least one neuronal subtype ( SI Appendix , Fig. S2 A ). Thus, our data offered a unique opportunity to compare the evolution of enhancers that are active in at least two closely related cell types. We found that, among these shared enhancers ( n = 35,676) (dark purple in Fig. 2 B ), 19,225 (∼54%) showed no evolutionary changes (gray panel in Fig. 2 C ), whereas the rest ( n = 16,451) changed between the species in at least one cell type (DA analyses between human and rhesus macaque in Glu or MGE-GABA, FC > 2; FDR < 0.05) (yellow, orange, and purple panels in Fig. 2 C ). We then asked whether evolutionary changes in the latter group were similar in Glu vs. MGE-GABA neurons. We categorized the enhancers into 1) enhancers with the same direction of evolutionary change in both Glu and MGE-GABA neurons (orange panels in Fig. 2 C ), 2) enhancers with an evolutionary change in only one cell type (yellow panels in Fig. 2 C ), and 3) enhancers with evolutionary changes of opposite directions in Glu and MGE-GABA neurons. The latter group represents a small subset of enhancers that may be functionally respecified ( 12 , 37 ), with activity switching from one neuronal subtype in one species to a different neuronal subtype in another species (purple panels in Fig. 2 C ). We used a linear model to further assess the statistical significance of these evolutionary events, assigning events to several categories depending on the proportion of variance explained by the corresponding factor (η 2 ) and the FDR value ( Methods and SI Appendix , Fig. S2 C ). By overlapping the results of this analysis with the DA analysis ( Fig. 2 C ), we identified 3,074 enhancers that changed in the same direction in both cell types, 2,425 enhancers that changed in one but not in the other cell type, and 100 enhancers that underwent a respecification ( Fig. 2 D and Dataset S8 ).\n",

      "Examples of these three types of evolutionary events are highlighted in Fig. 2 E – G . The enhancer in the PTCH2 locus showed increased activity in human vs. rhesus macaque in both neuronal subtypes ( Fig. 2 E ). Another enhancer, located ∼60 kb upstream of the MEF2A promoter, illustrates an evolutionary change that occurred in only one cell type. The pan-neuronal activity of this enhancer in rhesus macaque is contrasted with strictly Glu-specific H3K27ac signal in human ( Fig. 2 F ). Finally, an enhancer in the POLQ locus provides a rare example of respecification, as it is Glu-specific in human and MGE-GABA–specific in rhesus macaque ( Fig. 2 G ). Altogether, these results indicate that enhancers in conserved genomic positions between species in the same tissue can undergo different evolutionary changes in different cell types. Therefore, positional conservation of an enhancer is not always a reliable proxy for its functional conservation, suggesting that variation of enhancer activity between cell types is most likely greater than can be inferred based on positional conservation alone.\n",

      "We next examined how the evolutionary changes in the regulatory landscape of the neuronal subtypes are reflected in changes in gene expression. We performed RNA-seq on FANS-separated Glu and MGE-GABA nuclei purified from the same DLPFC specimens that were used for the H3K27ac profiling ( Dataset S1 ), obtaining high-quality transcriptomes for each species and cell type ( Methods , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 A – E , and Dataset S9 ). In agreement with previous findings in various bulk tissues and species ( 38 ), the expression of protein-coding genes ( n = 16,846) was much more conserved between species than the expression of long intergenic noncoding RNA genes ( n = 518) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 F ).\n",

      "Next, in each neuronal subtype, we identified DA GREs and differentially expressed (DE) genes that were enriched or depleted in a particular species compared to the two other species ( Fig. 3 A , Left and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 G , Upper ). We denoted these up-regulated or down-regulated GREs or genes as species-specific up- or down-DA GREs or DE genes. To focus on high-confidence DA GREs and DE genes, we applied conservative FC thresholds in both analyses (FC > 2, FDR < 0.05) ( Methods , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 G , Lower , and Datasets S10–S12 ). We found thousands of DA GREs and hundreds of DE genes for each comparison, with the largest numbers of species-specific GREs and genes detected in rhesus macaque ( Fig. 3 B and C ). The analysis of DE genes showed that approximately half of the genes that were species-specific in one neuronal subtype were also specific for the same species in another neuronal subtype ( Dataset S12 ). In addition, for both neuronal subtypes, the species-specific up-DE genes significantly overlapped with the up-DE genes that have been recently reported for the same species in sorted neuronal (NeuN + ) nuclei from the DLPFC (11 to 31% overlap for Glu DE genes and 12 to 23% overlap for MGE-GABA DE genes, P < 2.5e-6 by hypergeometric test) ( Dataset S13 ) ( 39 ). Also, our gene-expression data were in good agreement with the results of human vs. rhesus macaque DE analysis in bulk adult DLPFC reported by the PsychENCODE consortium (17 to 19% overlap, P < 2.8e-14 by hypergeometric test) ( Dataset S14 ) ( 40 ).\n",

( Dataset S15 ). Species-specific GREs were enriched for gene sets from several GO terms; however, the majority of these terms were not related to the nervous system ( Dataset S15 ). One exception was the enrichment of the human-specific DA GREs in Glu neurons for the “regulation of glutamate secretion” term (adjusted P value 0.019). Also of interest were the results of GO analysis for the pairwise interspecies comparisons ( Dataset S15 ). In MGE-GABA neurons, the GREs that were up-regulated in human vs. rhesus macaque were significantly enriched for the “L-type voltage gated calcium channels” term as well as for genes involved in “Wnt-activated receptor activity.” The Wnt pathway-related genes (e.g., FZD8 ) are known to influence cortical size ( 42 , 43 ).\n",

      "We then linked species-specific GREs to nearby genes using GREAT ( Methods ) and overlapped the resulting gene sets with genes showing species-specific expression ( Fig. 3 A , Right , SI Appendix , Fig. S3 H , and Datasets S16 and S17 ). This analysis yielded hundreds of genes with evidence of concordant species-specific evolutionary changes in gene expression and in at least one associated GRE ( Fig. 3 D ). The fraction of species-specific DE genes that had a concordant DA GRE varied for each species and was in the range of 18 to 30% in human, 17 to 26% in chimpanzee, and 40 to 53% in rhesus macaque for up- or down-regulated DE genes in Glu or MGE-GABA ( Dataset S18 ). We used random shuffling ( Methods ) to assess statistical significance of the observed concordant association between GREs and genes. For all categories of concordant changes (species-specific up- or down-regulated, Glu or MGE-GABA neurons, promoters or enhancers), concordant GRE-gene pairs were significantly overrepresented compared with random pairs (all P s < 1e-7) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 I ), indicating that the genes linked to DA regulatory elements are more likely to be DE than expected by chance. Thus, a sizable proportion of the identified concordant GRE-gene pairs likely represents functional associations that underlie evolutionary differences in gene expression between the primate species, rather than resulting from coincidental colocalizations of species-specific DA peaks and DE genes.\n",

Separation of GREs into promoters and enhancers showed that the majority of genes with concordant evolutionary changes in expression and promoter signal also had an evolutionary change in at least one enhancer (70% in Glu and 64% in MGE-GABA) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 J ). Finally, in all three species, concordant genes often associated with multiple concordant enhancers (23 to 45% of human- or chimpanzee-specific and ∼60% of rhesus macaque-specific concordant up- or down-regulated DE genes in Glu or MGE-GABA) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 K ).\n",

      "Whereas changes in promoter signals were associated with larger changes in gene expression compared with changes in enhancers ( Fig. 3 E and SI Appendix , Fig. S3 L ), the neuronal regulatory landscapes often encompass more than one enhancer per gene ( 6 , 44 ). Therefore, we asked if additional quantitative features that represent aggregate measures of an entire gene regulatory domain (as defined by GREAT with the basal plus extension setting) ( Methods ), such as the number of DA regulatory elements per gene ( 45 ) or the intensity of an enhancer signal (maximum and sum), could provide independent validation of the functional evolutionary change in a concordant DA enhancer-gene pair. We found that, in both neuronal subtypes, each of these regulatory features significantly correlated with gene expression ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 M and N ) and that evolutionary changes in these features were significantly correlated with evolutionary changes in gene expression (Spearman correlation, all P s < 2.2e-16) ( SI Appendix , Fig. S3 O and P ). Finally, we confirmed that the majority of the concordant enhancer-gene pairs represent genes with an evolutionary change not only in individual enhancer but also in the entire regulatory domain ( Fig. 3 F ). These gene sets, with their associated epigenetic features, are compiled in Dataset S19 , which provides a resource to enable future hypothesis-driven functional and evolutionary studies on primate brains.\n",

      "Two representative examples of human-specific concordant GRE-gene pairs are CAT and SLC17A8 loci ( Fig. 3 G – J ). CAT encodes the hydrogen peroxide-degrading enzyme catalase. CAT is more strongly expressed in Glu vs. MGE-GABA neurons and is preferentially expressed in hominids (i.e., humans and chimpanzees) vs. rhesus macaque, with a significantly higher expression in human vs. chimpanzee. In addition to the strong human-specific H3K27ac enrichment in the promoter, we also detected an enrichment in several Glu-specific CAT enhancers in human or chimpanzee vs. rhesus macaque. Accumulation of H 2 O 2 in oxidative metabolism has been linked to oxidative-stress–associated neurodegenerative disorders ( 46 ). Elevated expression of CAT in human neurons could, therefore, reflect the evolution of protective mechanisms that limit oxidative damage resulting from the higher metabolic activity of the human brain compared to that of chimpanzee ( 47 – 49 ). SLC17A8 encodes vesicular glutamate transporter 3 and is selectively up-regulated in human MGE-GABA neurons, with corresponding gains in human-specific enhancers. SLC17A8 is implicated in cocaine abuse ( 22 ) as well as in anxiety-related behaviors ( 50 ).\n",

      "Whereas the other eight genes associated with language impairment did not show any concordant evolutionary changes in their regulation and expression, we detected many human-specific (and often cell type-specific) DA GREs that were linked to several of these genes ( Dataset S20 ). Human-specific enhancers were found in CNTNAP2 ( n = 8 in Glu, n = 6 in MGE-GABA) and FOXP2 ( n = 1 in Glu) loci ( Fig. 4 A and SI Appendix , Fig. S4 A and B ). These two genes have been suggested to be required for the proper development of speech and language in humans ( 24 – 26 ). The functional importance of these regulatory changes remains unclear, as we did not observe any significant human-specific changes in gene expression for FOXP2 or CNTNAP2 . Nevertheless, it appears plausible that the increase in regulatory complexity engenders context-dependent mechanisms of regulation of FOXP2 or CNTNAP2 expression in anatomical (including brain areas and subpopulations of Glu or MGE-GABA neurons), environmental, or developmental contexts, which could, in turn, facilitate the emergence of language skills. Notably, cortical areas other than the DLPFC, such as the inferior frontal cortex and temporal cortex, constitute the core of the brain language network ( 56 , 57 ). The evolutionary changes in regulation and expression of FOXP2 or CNTNAP2 in these cortical areas remain to be investigated.\n",

In addition, an ASD-linked SNP, rs7794745 ( 59 ), which is located ∼280 bp from differentially methylated region B, colocalizes with the same CNTNAP2 enhancer ( Fig. 4 A ). The major allele nucleotide of rs7794745 (A > T) is a human-specific substitution compared to other primate species ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 C ). This enhancer was also identified and found to be up-regulated in ASD in a recent H3K27ac study in bulk brain tissues, including the PFC ( Fig. 4 A ) ( 60 ).

      "We found contiguous genomic regions with a high density of human-specific up-regulated GREs, which suggested a nonuniform distribution of these GREs across the genome. This trend is exemplified by an ∼1-Mb-long genomic region upstream of CDH8 on chromosome 16 that contains a cluster of 11 human-specific up-DA GREs in Glu neurons ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 D ). Applying stringent statistical analysis ( Methods ), we identified a significant enrichment of human up-DA GREs over the background distribution of all human GREs in 23 clusters, with 18 and 5 nonoverlapping clusters detected in Glu and MGE-GABA neurons, respectively ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 E ). Four Glu clusters contained a human-specific DE gene ( OPRM1 , GULP1 , NIT2 , PKDCC ). Several genes with important roles in the nervous system or neuropsychiatric disorders overlapped with the human up-DA GRE clusters. In particular, CDH8 encodes a neurite outgrowth-regulating membrane protein cadherin-8 and has been linked to ASD and learning disability ( 27 ). Similarly, ASTN2 is located within a Glu cluster on chromosome 9 and has been associated with ASD ( 29 ). Among the 76 genes located at Glu-neuronal DA clusters, 9 are associated with ASD according to the SFARI database ( https://www.sfari.org/resource/sfari-gene/ ) ( 61 ), which is a significant enrichment ( P = 0.02 by hypergeometric distribution). Notably, recent publications suggest that human-specific evolutionary changes in gene regulation and expression could be associated with risk for ASD ( 14 , 62 ). A previously described class of human genomic regions that harbor signatures of human-specific evolutionary changes consists of human-accelerated regions (HARs) ( 63 ). Three of the 18 Glu clusters overlapped with HARs (HAR2, HAR22, HAR47; Fisher’s exact test, P = 0.005), and each of these 3 HARs overlapped with a human Glu enhancer identified in our study.\n",

      "We were particularly interested in the cluster containing OPRM1 , a gene that encodes a receptor of endogenous opioid peptides and is implicated in opioid addiction ( Fig. 4 B – E ) ( 20 , 21 ). OPRM1 is expressed in the PFC, and μ-opioid receptor signaling in the PFC is implicated in altering executive control and motivational functions, which are important in drug addiction ( 64 ). The OPRM1 locus overlaps with one of the Glu clusters on chromosome 6 that contains 17 human- and Glu-specific up-DA enhancers, as well as a human- and Glu-specific up-DA promoter ( Fig. 4 B ). Concordant with these regulatory changes, OPRM1 expression is up-regulated in humans compared with the two primate species in Glu but not in MGE-GABA neurons ( Fig. 4 E ). We also found that two human-specific up-DA GREs within OPRM1 harbor risk SNPs associated with opioid addiction ( rs1799971 and rs3778150 ), which are situated within the OPRM1 promoter and one of its enhancers, respectively ( 65 , 66 ) ( Fig. 4 C ). Strikingly, the major allele nucleotide of rs3778150 (T > C) is a strictly human-specific substitution within a region that otherwise shows high sequence conservation across mammals ( Fig. 4 D ). The OPRM1 regulatory domain also provides an example of a respecification event, as it contains an enhancer that is active in Glu neurons in human but in MGE-GABA neurons in rhesus macaque ( Fig. 4 B ). Thus, the OPRM1 locus shows strong evidence of extensive evolutionary changes of its regulatory landscape that are coupled with concordant changes in gene expression specific to Glu neurons. In addition to OPRM1 , two other genes implicated in drug abuse, SLC17A8 (discussed above) ( Fig. 3 J ) and PENK ( SI Appendix , Fig. S4 F and G ), showed concordant evolutionary changes in gene expression and regulation. In contrast to OPRM1 , the changes in these two genes were specific to MGE-GABA neurons. Notably, among the eight genes that comprise the family of opioid ligands and receptors ( OPRM1 , OPRD1 , OPRK1 , OPRL1 , POMC , PENK , PDYN , PNOC ), we detected two concordant human-up-regulated DE genes ( OPRM1 and PENK ) (enrichment P = 0.01 by hypergeometric test). In summary, our findings suggest human-specific modification of cellular and molecular pathways implicated in drug addiction.\n",

      "Here, we demonstrate the value of analyzing isolated neuronal cell populations to increase the sensitivity and specificity of gene expression and GRE analysis compared with analyses of bulk cortical tissue. Our findings provide insight into the cell-type–specific regulatory landscape of the primate brain and its evolution. Our analyses show that neuron-subtype–specific regulatory elements preferentially changed during primate evolution as compared with elements that are active in multiple neuronal subtypes. This greater evolutionary plasticity of neuron-subtype–specific GRE suggests that an alteration of a regulatory element that is beneficial or neutral when it occurs in a single cell type could be detrimental when it involves multiple cell or tissue types ( 67 ). We also detected regulatory elements that, despite being active in both Glu and MGE-GABA neurons of one species, were active in a specific cell type in other species. Thus, the assumption that a GRE that is active in multiple cell types (or tissues) represents a functionally conserved regulatory element is likely to be overly simplistic. Rather, these enhancer regions might employ different sets of transcription factor binding sites in different cell types and species, activating distinct regulatory programs.\n",

      "Supporting these observations, we identified numerous regulatory elements whose activity showed neuron subtype-specific evolutionary changes in humans (5,259 in Glu and 2,415 in MGE-GABA). We also detected 165 genes in Glu and 80 genes in MGE-GABA in humans with strong evidence of concordant evolutionary changes in their expression and the activity of at least one GRE. For the majority of these genes, the evolutionary change was detected across the entire regulatory domain (quantified as the number of evolved enhancers per gene and the magnitude of the enhancer H3K27ac signal). These findings demonstrate the functional importance of regulatory evolution in different neuronal subtypes. For example, enrichment of H3K27ac in the promoter and enhancers of the catalase gene ( CAT ) in human Glu neurons is associated with a concordant human-specific up-regulation of gene expression, which could protect these neurons against oxidative stress caused by the high metabolic activity of the human brain ( 47 – 49 ). The limitation of our study is that genes were linked to their putative enhancers using the distance-based assignment, which is complicated by the mostly unknown high-order chromatin structure. The latter can be assessed by genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (e.g., Hi-C) ( 68 , 69 ). However, currently, Hi-C data are not available for Glu or MGE-GABA subtypes, precluding more accurate linking between promoters and their distal regulatory elements.\n",

      "Complex spoken language is unique for humans, and the development of language was essential to human evolution, through enabling efficient exchange of information, higher-order social organization as well as specializations of cognition and symbolic thinking. Our study emphasizes the importance of regulatory evolution in the development of language abilities and in the emergence of disorders associated with language. We identified two language-associated genes with strong human-specific ( ATP2C2 ) or hominid-specific ( DCDC2 ) as well as neuron subtype-dependent concordant changes in expression and regulatory landscapes. We also discovered human-specific regulatory changes in Glu and GABA neurons in the FOXP2 and CNTNAP2 genes that are crucial for brain development, neural plasticity, and language abilities ( 2 , 25 ). FOXP2 encodes Forkhead box protein P2 (FoxP2), a transcription factor that is expressed at high levels in the brain during fetal development ( 70 ). Many FoxP2 targets (including CNTNAP2 ) are implicated in schizophrenia and ASD ( 71 , 72 ). ASD is characterized by difficulties in social communication (including language), and previous analyses have uncovered a link between ASD and HARs, suggesting that certain aspects of ASD evolved specifically in humans ( 62 ). Notably, here we found that human-specific regulatory elements in neurons are not uniformly distributed in the human genome, and that clusters of these GREs in Glu neurons are enriched for HARs and genes associated with ASD.\n",

      "Unexpectedly, we also identified concordant evolutionary changes in GREs and expression for several genes that have been implicated in drug addiction, with OPRM1 showing an extensive reorganization of its regulatory domain and a pronounced up-regulation of expression, specifically, in human Glu neurons compared with chimpanzee and rhesus macaque. Because OPRM1 is one of the strongest candidates for affecting risk for opioid-use disorder ( 65 , 66 , 73 ), our findings suggest that vulnerability to opioid addiction might have a unique human component. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is currently no support for the involvement of regulatory evolution in propensity to opioid addiction.\n",

      "The findings presented in this work highlight the importance of differential regulatory changes in major neuronal subtypes in brain evolution and brain disorders. These results call for further analyses that will connect evolutionary changes in regulation with those in gene expression in multiple subpopulations of neuronal and glial cells, in different brain areas, and across developmental trajectories, perhaps using single-cell based approaches currently under development ( 16 ). These future studies will help to uncover the complex regulatory interaction networks that underlie the evolution of human brain function and human-specific traits, and hence will further advance the understanding of neuropsychiatric disorders.\n",

      "Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has been applied to investigate the molecular causes of cancer in several tumor types, but analysis has mainly focused on the protein-coding regions ( Lawrence et al, 2013 ). However, because the majority of cancer genomic alterations are located in the noncoding regions, several recent studies have conducted detailed investigations on the impact of noncoding mutations in cancer ( Hess et al, 2019 ; Liu et al, 2019 ; Kumar et al, 2020 ; Zhu et al, 2020 ). The impact of noncoding mutations has mainly been signified by recent discoveries of driver mutations in the TERT promoter, enhancers of PAX5 and TAL and other regulatory elements ( Huang et al, 2013 ; Fredriksson et al, 2014 ; Mansour et al, 2014 ; Weinhold et al, 2014 ; Katainen et al, 2015 ; Melton et al, 2015 ; Nik-Zainal et al, 2016 ; Rheinbay et al, 2017 ). Recent efforts from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project provided further evidence on the importance of noncoding mutations by identifying driver mutations in several noncoding regions including the 5′ region of TP53 and 3′ untranslated regions of NFKBIZ and TOB1 ( Rheinbay et al, 2020 ). However, the large size of the noncoding genome in combination with sparse distribution of mutations in the genome has made it difficult to identify regulatory mutations in particular those that might not be highly recurrent ( Sur & Taipale, 2016 ). To overcome this issue, two approaches are followed: (i) mutational burden tests ( Lawrence et al, 2014 ; Lanzós et al, 2017 ; Zhu et al, 2020 ) that have limited power because they require large number of samples and (ii) functional tests ( Fu et al, 2014 ; Lochovsky et al, 2015 ; Mularoni et al, 2016 ) investigating regulatory elements that are limited by the availability of biological experiments and tissue specificity of regulatory elements. As a result, the role of noncoding mutations has been underestimated since many of the previous statistical analyses have considered mutation recurrence or an insufficient set of functional elements ( Weinhold et al, 2014 ; Rheinbay et al, 2017 ).\n",

      "Section Title: Introduction. Content: Introduction\n",
      "In addition, the complexity of the regulatory circuitry has hampered pinpointing functions of the noncoding mutations ( Fu et al, 2014 ; Lochovsky et al, 2015 ; Mularoni et al, 2016 ). Also, cell type specificity of regulatory elements indicates that the same mutations may be functional only in certain cancer types depending on functionality of the regulatory elements. Recent large-scale efforts of the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) and the Roadmap Epigenomics projects have provided functional annotations for identifying cell type–specific regulatory elements ( ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012 ; Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium et al, 2015 ). Integrating these resources with cancer genomes provided in the PCAWG project ( ICGC/TCGA Pan-Cancer Analysis Genomes Consortium, 2020 ) presents an opportunity to characterize the noncoding variants of individual tumor types.\n",

      "We have used a unique approach to identify mutations that affect transcription factor (TF) motifs in tissues that are relevant to the tumor type. Our research design is motivated by the immediate impact of TFs on gene regulation. To this end, we used cell type–specific annotations to perform a comprehensive analysis of somatic mutations in the PCAWG project and found many mutations in regulatory elements that are candidates to be functional.\n",

      "We obtained high-quality somatic mutations from 2,515 tumor samples in 37 cancer types from the PCAWG project (See the Materials and Methods section and Fig S1 ). The vast majority of the mutations were located in the noncoding genome of which a fraction is expected to be functional. We reasoned that only mutations with regulatory functions in relevant cells and motifs should be considered. 85.8% of the mutations overlapped ENCODE DNaseI hypersensitive sites (DHSs) or TF binding sites (TFBSs) irrespective of cell type specificity (n = 105 cell lines) whereas only 3.7% of the mutations overlapped DHSs or TFBSs from cell lines matching the cancer types ( Fig 1A ). Nearly four million mutations overlapped TF motifs ( Fig S2 ). However, only about 1.8% of them overlapped matching TF peaks and another 5.7% were marked by DHSs in matching cell lines ( Fig 1B and D ), whereas inactive chromatin states had a high load of somatic mutations ( Fig 1C ).\n",

Interestingly, matching TFBSs and DHSs from relevant cell lines had 90% and 79% positive predictive power in identifying functional motifs, respectively. Thus, a regulatory score was computed for each mutated motif using the funMotifs framework ( Umer et al, 2019 Preprint ). Also, we re-annotated the entire set of TF motifs using simulated mutations from 103 randomized sets to enable statistical evaluation of the regulatory scores.\n",

      "We performed cohort-specific analysis to identify regulatory mutations in 44 cohorts ( Rheinbay et al, 2020 ) ( Fig 1D ). The cohort set included a Pan-CCancer cohort combining all tumors except lymphoma and melanoma (ATELM). The statistical analyses to identify regulatory mutations and mutated regulatory elements were conducted on each cohort separately ( Fig S3 ). Because multiple neighboring mutated motifs may affect the same regulatory element, we defined mutated elements by merging mutated motifs within 200 bp (see the Materials and Methods section). To account for local hypermutated regions, we assessed the significance of the regulatory score of each element by comparing it to a local background distribution of simulated elements within a 50 kb window and only those with empirical P -value < 0.05 were retained (Table S1 and Fig S4 ). However, because of the lack of a well-designed simulated mutation dataset that recapitulates mutation occurrence in various cancer types, we enforced additional conditions on the significant elements. To this end, the mutation significance level of each element was evaluated using ActiveDriverWGS and those with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were kept (see the Materials and Methods section) ( Zhu et al, 2020 ). To ensure the regulatory role of the mutated elements, we also conditioned the elements to contain at least one regulatory mutation. As depicted in Fig 1E , mutations in the significant elements with high impact on TF motifs and overlapping chromatin signals in a matching tissue type were defined as regulatory mutations (see the Materials and Methods section). Moreover, to avoid removing mutations due to the lack of motif predictions for TFs or the lack of ChIP-seq experiments in the designated cell lines, we extended the mutated elements to be of a typical regulatory element size (200 bp) and additional mutations that were located in the regulatory elements were retained. The element size was based on the observation that most TFs in the same regulatory element bind within 200 bp ( Diamanti et al, 2016 ). The final set of recurrent regulatory elements was conditioned to be mutated in at least three samples. These analyses provided the set of significant mutated elements that have potential regulatory roles per cohort. Across the 44 cohorts 98,302 regulatory mutations were identified (Table S2). Initially, FOXP1, IRF1, and ZNF263 each had more than one million predicted motifs and therefore they were most enriched for mutations in comparison to other TFs. However, after conditioning on the functional annotations defined here only a small fraction of the mutated motifs remained ( Fig S5 ).\n",

      "To characterize the mutational processes underlying mutations in TFBSs ( Alexandrov et al, 2013 , 2020 ), we examined differences in the mutational context of regulatory mutations identified above and the remaining mutations per cancer type (see the Materials and Methods section). Overall, 46 single-base substitution (SBS) and double-base substitution (DBS) signatures had a significantly different contribution in at least one cancer type (Kolmogorov–Smirnov two-sided test, P -value < 0.05, Fig 2 ). Interestingly, enrichment of SBS1, SBS30, and SBS39 was higher for regulatory mutations, whereas enrichment of SBS8, SB12, and SBS36 was lower in at least 15 cancer types. These signatures have previously been reported as the most common signatures across the tumors in PCAWG ( Alexandrov et al, 2020 ). Notably, APOBEC associated signatures (SBS2, SBS13, and SBS69) were significantly less enriched for regulatory mutations in many cancer types ( Rheinbay et al, 2020 ). We also measured the cosine similarity between trinucleotide context profiles of the regulatory mutations and COSMIC SBS signatures v3 (see the Materials and Methods section) ( Tate et al, 2019 ). The cosine similarity levels were low for most of the SBS signatures (mean cosine similarity = 0.26, standard deviation = 0.17). The differences in the signatures associated with regulatory mutations and other mutations may suggest that different processes are involved in creating mutations in TFBSs ( Fig 2 ).\n",

Furthermore, the cosine similarity between the context of regulatory mutations in skin melanomas and the COSMIC signatures was below 0.42 for all SBS signatures (median value = 0.06, Fig 2 ) except SBS7a and SBS7b that are associated to UV-light ( Fig S6 , see the Materials and Methods section).\n",

      "Next, we asked whether regulatory mutations target motifs of any specific TF ( Fig 3A ). In agreement with previous studies, we found CTCF as the most mutated TF in most of the cohorts. Its motifs were mostly mutated in digestive tract tumors (3,784 CTCF mutated motifs, P -value = 0.0097), esophagus cancers (1,154, P -value = 0.0097), liver-HCC (1,570, P -value = 0.0097), and skin melanomas (1,016, P -value = 0.0097, Fig 3B ) ( Katainen et al, 2015 ; Sabarinathan et al, 2016 ; Umer et al, 2016 ). In the ATELM cohort, 5,968 CTCF motifs were mutated ( P -value = 0.0097); 25.5% and 18.3% of those were in liver-HCC and in esophagus cancers, respectively. Interestingly, the mutational profile of regulatory mutations in CTCF motif showed an overrepresentation of SBS17b signature in esophagus, lymph-NOS, colorectal, and stomach cancers ( Fig S7 ). Also, the cosine similarity between the profile context of the CTCF regulatory mutations in these cancer types and SBS17b was between 0.6 and 0.72. The etiology of the SBS17b signature is unknown, nevertheless the association of the oxidative damage of DNA and SBS17b in gastrointestinal cancers has been reported previously ( Kauppi et al, 2016 ; Tomkova et al, 2018 ). Sabarinathan et al (2016) have attributed mutations at active motifs of CTCF and other TFs in melanomas to impairment of the DNA repair machinery. However, even though CTCF bindings in GM12878 are almost as abundant as in HepG2 (human liver carcinoma cells) and keratinocytes, the mutation rate in CTCF motifs was much lower in the lymphomas compared to liver cancers and melanomas. Notably, signatures SBS7a and SBS7b that are characteristic for the UV-light exposure were enriched for CTCF mutations in melanomas ( Fig S7 ) and had the highest cosine similarity (SBS7a: 0.50 and SBS7b: 0.82) among the other UV-light signatures. Finally, in lung cancers (Lung-AdenoCA and Lung-SCC) SBS4 signature, which is associated to tobacco smoking, had the highest contribution ( Letouzé et al, 2017 ). Overall, different spectra of mutational signatures were observed at CTCF motifs in different cancer types.\n",

Furthermore, 17.1% of the motifs were mutated in two or more samples.

Elevation in expression of CEBPB has been linked with progression of glioblastoma, lymphoma, and breast cancer ( van de Vijver et al, 2002 ; Jundt et al, 2005 ; Homma et al, 2006 ; Piva et al, 2006 ).\n",

Finally, we observed that the active motifs of CEBPB are significantly less methylated genome-wide than inactive motifs and still there is an abundance of mutations at position 5 (Mann–Whitney test, P -value < 0.01, see the Materials and Methods section). Sayeed et al (2015) have performed EMSA experiments showing subtle effects of methylation in the CG site on CEBPB binding.

The lower enrichment of SBSB5 signature and lower methylation level at position 5 and 6 of the CEBPB motif may indicate other mechanisms than clock-wise mutational processes.

      "As it has previously been reported, the well-known TERT promoter was the most mutated element ( Fig 4 ) ( Fredriksson et al, 2014 ; Rheinbay et al, 2020 ).

EGR1 has been shown to down-regulate TERT expression and it has been suggested as a tumor suppressor ( Mittelbronn et al, 2009 ). Creation of a de novo ETS motif at the EGR1 motif locus has been shown to up-regulate TERT expression ( Pagel et al, 2012 ). Although the TERT promoter is reported as the most recurrent element in our analysis, creation of the de novo ETS motif is not reported because our analysis is based on pre-annotated motifs. Therefore, additional candidate mutations creating de novo motifs will identify further candidate elements.\n",

      "Previous analyses of regulatory elements have reported the 5′ UTR of WDR74 as a significantly mutated element ( Weinhold et al, 2014 ). However, in our analysis despite a high number of somatic mutations that resided in the element ( n = 31 mutations), only two of them were identified as regulatory mutations ( P -value = 0.01). Also, the mutations in the element were scattered across motifs of multiple TFs. Therefore, most of the mutations in this element have no effect on regulation of WDR74 . Notably, Weinhold et al (2014) did not find altered transcription levels of WDR74 in mutated tumor samples, and Rheinbay et al (2020) filtered out the elements associated to WDR74 owing to mapping issues. These results show that functional annotations are needed to overcome the limits of mutational burden tests because not all mutations in a regulatory element are functional. This also indicates that our method is complementary to previous methods for finding coding and noncoding candidates.\n",

      "We also found multiple genes with several recurrent mutated elements in various gene regions, mostly in introns. For instance, Suppressor Of Cytokine Signalling 1 ( SOCS1 ) had a recurrent element in its proximal promoter in prostate, colorectal and pancreatic cancer samples (FDR < 0.00225, Fig 5A ). It also had recurrent elements in 5′ UTR and the first intron in 9 lymphoma samples ( Fig S13 ). SOCS1 is a known oncogene in many cancer types including lymphoma ( Beaurivage et al, 2016 ; Chevrier et al, 2017 ; Khan et al, 2020 ; Liu et al, 2003 ). Interestingly, the intergenic region nearby TRIB2 was highly enriched for mutated elements (three elements with FDR < 0.0014), and its expression was significantly increased in the mutant bladder cancer samples compared to the samples that lacked mutations in the associated elements excluding samples that had copy number variants (CNVs) at the loci ( Fig 5B , see the Materials and Methods section). Expression of TRIB2 is increased in melanoma, colon and pancreatic cancer which leads to impaired therapeutic response and poor clinical outcome ( Hill et al, 2017 ). Furthermore, MED10 had multiple hotspots in its promoter, and an associated intergenic region (FDR < 0.022). The elements were mostly found in kidney, pancreas, lung, head, esophagus and bladder cancers. MED10 was significantly up-regulated in bladder mutant samples ( P -value = 0.02, Fig 5C ). Increased expression of MED10 is associated with poor outcome in liver, renal cancer and glioma ( MED10 prognostics from https://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000133398-MED10 , Uhlén et al, 2015 ).

Interestingly, Bach1::Mafk and TCF12 motif were most enriched for mutations at this hotspot and were mutated in 46 and 44 samples, respectively.

Overall, we identified 362 genes that were enriched for mutations in 10 or more samples by combining genes within 2 kb upstream/downstream of the mutated elements. The closest gene was considered when genes were not present in the 2 kb proximity from the mutated elements (see the Materials and Methods section, Table S6). The list comprised genes with established roles in cancer such as CTNNA2 (n = 54 samples), TERT (38), CTNNA3 (37), LRP1B (33), PTPRT (33), CDH11 (28), FGF12 (24), DCC (21), FGF13 (21), and RUNX1T1 (21).

      "We performed cohort-specific analysis to identify regulatory mutations in 44 cohorts ( Rheinbay et al, 2020 ) ( Fig 1D ). The cohort set included a Pan-CCancer cohort combining all tumors except lymphoma and melanoma (ATELM). The statistical analyses to identify regulatory mutations and mutated regulatory elements were conducted on each cohort separately ( Fig S3 ). Because multiple neighboring mutated motifs may affect the same regulatory element, we defined mutated elements by merging mutated motifs within 200 bp (see the Materials and Methods section). To account for local hypermutated regions, we assessed the significance of the regulatory score of each element by comparing it to a local background distribution of simulated elements within a 50 kb window and only those with empirical P -value < 0.05 were retained (Table S1 and Fig S4 ). However, because of the lack of a well-designed simulated mutation dataset that recapitulates mutation occurrence in various cancer types, we enforced additional conditions on the significant elements. To this end, the mutation significance level of each element was evaluated using ActiveDriverWGS and those with false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05 were kept (see the Materials and Methods section) ( Zhu et al, 2020 ). To ensure the regulatory role of the mutated elements, we also conditioned the elements to contain at least one regulatory mutation. As depicted in Fig 1E , mutations in the significant elements with high impact on TF motifs and overlapping chromatin signals in a matching tissue type were defined as regulatory mutations (see the Materials and Methods section). Moreover, to avoid removing mutations due to the lack of motif predictions for TFs or the lack of ChIP-seq experiments in the designated cell lines, we extended the mutated elements to be of a typical regulatory element size (200 bp) and additional mutations that were located in the regulatory elements were retained. The element size was based on the observation that most TFs in the same regulatory element bind within 200 bp ( Diamanti et al, 2016 ). The final set of recurrent regulatory elements was conditioned to be mutated in at least three samples. These analyses provided the set of significant mutated elements that have potential regulatory roles per cohort. Across the 44 cohorts 98,302 regulatory mutations were identified (Table S2). Initially, FOXP1, IRF1, and ZNF263 each had more than one million predicted motifs and therefore they were most enriched for mutations in comparison to other TFs. However, after conditioning on the functional annotations defined here only a small fraction of the mutated motifs remained ( Fig S5 ).\n",

Overall, 46 single-base substitution (SBS) and double-base substitution (DBS) signatures had a significantly different contribution in at least one cancer type (Kolmogorov–Smirnov two-sided test, P -value < 0.05, Fig 2 ). Interestingly, enrichment of SBS1, SBS30, and SBS39 was higher for regulatory mutations, whereas enrichment of SBS8, SB12, and SBS36 was lower in at least 15 cancer types. These signatures have previously been reported as the most common signatures across the tumors in PCAWG ( Alexandrov et al, 2020 ). Notably, APOBEC associated signatures (SBS2, SBS13, and SBS69) were significantly less enriched for regulatory mutations in many cancer types ( Rheinbay et al, 2020 ). We also measured the cosine similarity between trinucleotide context profiles of the regulatory mutations and COSMIC SBS signatures v3 (see the Materials and Methods section) ( Tate et al, 2019 ). The cosine similarity levels were low for most of the SBS signatures (mean cosine similarity = 0.26, standard deviation = 0.17).

      "Next, we asked whether regulatory mutations target motifs of any specific TF ( Fig 3A ). In agreement with previous studies, we found CTCF as the most mutated TF in most of the cohorts. Its motifs were mostly mutated in digestive tract tumors (3,784 CTCF mutated motifs, P -value = 0.0097), esophagus cancers (1,154, P -value = 0.0097), liver-HCC (1,570, P -value = 0.0097), and skin melanomas (1,016, P -value = 0.0097, Fig 3B ) ( Katainen et al, 2015 ; Sabarinathan et al, 2016 ; Umer et al, 2016 ). In the ATELM cohort, 5,968 CTCF motifs were mutated ( P -value = 0.0097); 25.5% and 18.3% of those were in liver-HCC and in esophagus cancers, respectively. Interestingly, the mutational profile of regulatory mutations in CTCF motif showed an overrepresentation of SBS17b signature in esophagus, lymph-NOS, colorectal, and stomach cancers ( Fig S7 ). Also, the cosine similarity between the profile context of the CTCF regulatory mutations in these cancer types and SBS17b was between 0.6 and 0.72. The etiology of the SBS17b signature is unknown, nevertheless the association of the oxidative damage of DNA and SBS17b in gastrointestinal cancers has been reported previously ( Kauppi et al, 2016 ; Tomkova et al, 2018 ). Sabarinathan et al (2016) have attributed mutations at active motifs of CTCF and other TFs in melanomas to impairment of the DNA repair machinery. However, even though CTCF bindings in GM12878 are almost as abundant as in HepG2 (human liver carcinoma cells) and keratinocytes, the mutation rate in CTCF motifs was much lower in the lymphomas compared to liver cancers and melanomas. Notably, signatures SBS7a and SBS7b that are characteristic for the UV-light exposure were enriched for CTCF mutations in melanomas ( Fig S7 ) and had the highest cosine similarity (SBS7a: 0.50 and SBS7b: 0.82) among the other UV-light signatures. Finally, in lung cancers (Lung-AdenoCA and Lung-SCC) SBS4 signature, which is associated to tobacco smoking, had the highest contribution ( Letouzé et al, 2017 ).

In the ATELM cohort, 1,436 CEBPB motifs were mutated ( P -value = 0.0097; fold-enrichment = 1.7 over the background enrichment), which was higher than the other significantly mutated TF motifs, that is, CEBPBG (654 motifs), CEBPD (336), ZBTB33 (409), CEBPE (323), and SPI1 (866), See Fig 3C . Furthermore, 17.1% of the motifs were mutated in two or more samples. CEBPB has been shown to regulate survival, apoptosis and senescence ( Zhu et al, 2002 ; Sterneck et al, 2006 ; Kurzejamska et al, 2014 ; Barakat et al, 2015 ; Tamura et al, 2015 ) and increased mutation rate in its motif has been reported ( Melton et al, 2015 ; Vorontsov et al, 2016 ). Elevation in expression of CEBPB has been linked with progression of glioblastoma, lymphoma, and breast cancer ( van de Vijver et al, 2002 ; Jundt et al, 2005 ; Homma et al, 2006 ; Piva et al, 2006 ).\n",

      "Notably, positions five and six that define a 5′—C—phosphate—G—3′ (CpG) site within the CEBPB motif were most significantly mutated motif positions of all TFs excluding CTCF in the ATELM cohort ( Fig 3D ). As expected, the majority of the mutations at position five and six of the motif were C>T (94.2%) and G>A (88.4%), respectively ( Fig 3E ). C>T mutations are characteristic of the SBS1 signature. Thus, the mutational profile of CEBPB motifs at position five and six could clearly be explained by the SBS1 signature with a cosine similarity of 0.8 compared to 0.52 for the remaining mutations ( Figs S9 and S10 ).\n",

      "Because SBS1 is characterized by deamination of 5-methylcytosine to thymine in double stranded DNA that mainly causes C to T transitions in CpG contexts, we investigated the methylation pattern within CEBPB motifs. Analysis of methylation data from the same tumors indicated a significantly lower mutation rate at methylated cytosine-guanine (CG) dinucleotides within CEBPB motifs in comparison to neighboring methylated CG dinucleotides (Fisher’s exact test, P -value = 0.012, odds ratio = 3.83, see the Materials and Methods section). Finally, we observed that the active motifs of CEBPB are significantly less methylated genome-wide than inactive motifs and still there is an abundance of mutations at position 5 (Mann–Whitney test, P -value < 0.01, see the Materials and Methods section). Sayeed et al (2015) have performed EMSA experiments showing subtle effects of methylation in the CG site on CEBPB binding. Notably, they found that 5-methylcytosine at the CG site enhances binding of CEBPB. Enhanced binding of CEBPB with C>T mutations at base 5 of the motif was recently confirmed by Ershova et al (2020) Preprint .\n",

      "Besides SBS1, the most common mutational signature in regulatory mutations at CEBPB motifs across most cancer types was SBS5, which is characterized by enrichment of T>C and C>T mutations. The etiology of SBS5 is unknown; however, SBS1 and SBS5 signatures are highly age-correlated ( Alexandrov et al, 2020 ). The cosine similarity between the mutational profile of CEBPB motifs and the SBS5 signature was noticeably higher for the mutations outside positions 5 and 6 (cosine similarity = 0.64) than mutations at positions 5 and 6 of the CEBPB motif (cosine similarity = 0.11, Figs S9 and S10 ). The lower enrichment of SBSB5 signature and lower methylation level at position 5 and 6 of the CEBPB motif may indicate other mechanisms than clock-wise mutational processes. Finally, by analyzing RNA-seq from matching samples, we found that expression of genes in the proximity of CEPB motifs (2 kb) was significantly dysregulated in the mutated samples (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P -value < 0.05, see the Materials and Methods section).\n",

However, in our analysis despite a high number of somatic mutations that resided in the element ( n = 31 mutations), only two of them were identified as regulatory mutations ( P -value = 0.01). Also, the mutations in the element were scattered across motifs of multiple TFs. Therefore, most of the mutations in this element have no effect on regulation of WDR74 . Notably, Weinhold et al (2014) did not find altered transcription levels of WDR74 in mutated tumor samples, and Rheinbay et al (2020) filtered out the elements associated to WDR74 owing to mapping issues. These results show that functional annotations are needed to overcome the limits of mutational burden tests because not all mutations in a regulatory element are functional.

Expression of TRIB2 is increased in melanoma, colon and pancreatic cancer which leads to impaired therapeutic response and poor clinical outcome ( Hill et al, 2017 ).

Our study is the largest analysis of noncoding mutations in TF motifs to date. A rigorous annotation pipeline was applied to identify functional TF motifs in cell types matching the corresponding cancer. The cancer type–specific annotations led to the identification of regulatory mutations that had a significant impact on TF motifs. Mutational signature analysis indicated different mutational processes underlying regulatory mutations in comparison to other mutations.

      "Two approaches were applied to identify recurrent events that may point to positive selection in cancer. The first approach was to identify recurrent mutation patterns by accounting for the sparse distribution of noncoding mutations. In addition to CTCF, we identified mutations in motifs of CEBPB across many cancer types and, in particular, mutations affecting the CpG site of the motif that were attributable to the SBS1 signature. It has been shown that methylation improves binding of the CEBP family so mutating the CpG may affect binding by both changing the motif and preventing DNA methylation ( Vinson & Chatterjee, 2012 ; Sayeed et al, 2015 ; Yin et al, 2017 ). CEBP proteins have also been found to be critical for activation of tissue specific promoters in many tissues ( Buck et al, 2001 ; Rishi et al, 2010 ). Therefore, mutations at these sites are highly suggestive of potential effects on the target genes. Most of the enriched cancer types had a similar mutation rates in CEBPB motifs whereas CTCF motifs were highly mutated particularly in gastrointestinal cancers and melanomas, whereas lymphoma cohorts were not enriched for recurrent patterns.\n",

      "Section Title: Discussion. Content: Discussion\n",
      "Our second approach was to identify functional regulatory elements that were recurrently mutated. Performing meta-cohort analysis by integrating multiple cancer types was key to identify highly mutated elements across the cancer types. We observed a significant enrichment of cancer-associated genes near the identified recurrent elements indicating that cancer genes lacking coding mutations may be differentially expressed because of mutations in their regulatory elements. Furthermore, many cancer pathways were significantly enriched for genes that were associated to the mutated regulatory elements. These findings suggest a role of noncoding mutations in cancer, especially when looking for functional mutations and not only drivers.\n",

      "We expect a higher number of candidate functional mutations to be eventually found since we have only included established TF motifs in our analysis. Therefore, future analysis investigating de novo motifs will identify further candidate mutations that enhance binding of TFs. Also, discovery of further TF models and generating new datasets for cell types or TFs that are not yet assayed will improve identification of regulatory elements. Finally, the power to detect regulatory mutations is smaller than for finding coding mutations. The reason is that coding sequences mainly are the same between cancer types whereas enhancer and other regulatory elements differ between cell types limiting the possibility to find recurrent events. Therefore, larger studies are needed to find all functional and recurrent elements that are mutated in cancer.\n",

      "Evolution by natural selection occurs in populations having heritable phenotypic variation and environmental selection forces that act on births and deaths. Within a given environment, well-adapted phenotypes proliferate at the expense of those that are poorly adapted, and their phenotypic properties are propagated across generations through genetic and epigenetic mechanisms of inheritance. In addition, an organisms’ adaptations can include niche engineering [ 1 ] in which they alter their habitat (e.g., a beaver dam or angiogenesis) to locally increase their own fitness. Later generations then inherit this ecological niche. Collectively, these interacting dynamics form “The ecological theater and evolutionary play” [ 2 ].\n",

      "Somatic evolution in cancer cell populations results in phenotypic adaptations to myriad intracellular and extracellular barriers to uncontrolled proliferation. Furthermore, once a cancer population has emerged, it is subjected to heterogeneous intra-tumoral microenvironments producing diverse microenvironmental niches and corresponding adapted cancer cell subpopulations. However, multiple genetic pathways can achieve identical phenotypic properties [ 3 ] and this heterogeneity is a fundamental challenge to characterizing somatic evolution and optimizing tumor treatment.\n",

      "We applied an approach analogous to identifying environmental selection forces and phenotypic adaptive strategies using molecular data from cave fish [ 4 ]. Cave fish live in constant darkness and have a convergent phenotype characterized by loss of eyes [ 5 ] and skin pigmentation and gain of function in tactile organs. Over 85 fish species have evolved a cave morph demonstrating multiple genetic pathways [ 6 ] can converge to the same phenotype [ 4 ]. Observations of the cave fish phenotype readily identify some of their adaptive strategies and, therefore, environmental selection forces. Conversely, analysis of molecular data from a single cave fish provides only limited insights because diverse genetic pathways can lead to the same morphology [ 7 ]. However, molecular data from a cohort of fish from different caves will demonstrate common patterns of genetic changes related to eyes, skin, and tactile organs revealing the selection forces (i.e., constant darkness) and adaptive strategies. Additionally, such sampling can produce novel insights, for example, such as the unexpected role of environmental hypoxia in cavefish physiology [ 8 ]. Here, we similarly investigate patterns of genetic, epigenetic, and ecological inheritance to infer convergent phenotypic properties and the associated environmental selection forces.\n",

      "In prior studies [ 9 , 10 ], we found cancer cells appear to adapt to a relatively fixed number of intracellular and extracellular barriers to unconstrained proliferation [ 10 ]. Driver genes function by simultaneously overcoming many barriers through their interactomes. In contrast, cancer without driver genes must adapt to each barrier more or less one at a time. Thus, we hypothesized maximum insight into convergent adaptive strategies [ 11 ] would be obtained from cohorts of cancers without driver genes that evolved in the same tissue environment.\n",

      "Here, we demonstrate NCD LUADs converge to a phenotype that loses differentiated functions of normal lung epithelial cells, including gas exchange and circadian entrainment, as well as membrane proteins related to cellular interactions with other cells and the extracellular matrix that govern 3-dimensional tissue organization. Like the eyes of a cavefish, these functions incur a cost and provide no fitness benefit to a cancer cell. Across patients, consistent selection of specific collagen and protease family demonstrates that appear to direct niche engineering of stiff, immunosuppressive microenvironments. The convergent phenotype conserves and upregulates genes related to cell cycle, mitosis, the p53 pathway, and epigenetic modification. Although no canonical driver gene pathways exhibit strong selection, we find striking down-regulation of membrane ion channels suggesting loss of the transmembrane potential may generate a driver phenotype that promotes unconstrained proliferation. We find a complex but consistent selection on elements of adaptive immunity, inflammation, and antigen presentation suggesting potential strategies for therapeutic intervention in this class of LUAD.\n",

      "We divided the TCGA lung adenocarcinoma cohort based on known driver mutations in KRAS (G12, G13, Q61, A146), BRAF (V600, N581, G464, G466, G469, G596, D594), and EGFR (L858, S768, L861, G719, T790, indels in exons 18–21). The 313 non-EGFR/KRAS/BRAF patients were classified as no common driver (NCD). Somatic mutations were downloaded from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas [ 12 ]. Tumor and normal sequence alignment files used to calculate individual base coverage were downloaded from Genome Data Commons. A base was considered sufficiently covered if the depth of coverage was ≥ 14 in tumor sample and ≥ 8 in normal samples as has been previously described: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1695394 . The fraction of each gene’s protein coding bases (using the longest RefSeq transcript) covered by sufficient sequence data was calculated for each sample using the Negative Storage Model [ 13 ]. Gene-level depth of coverage was then determined by calculating the number of bases sufficiently covered by sequencing for each of the RefSeq coding genes (with 25 base-pair flanking regions). This procedure measures the fraction of each gene (longest transcript) covered by sequencing data. To address sequencing artifacts that falsely decrease mutation rates, we excluded genes with low average depth of coverage frequency (< 50%) and those with errors in the RefSeq gene model.\n",

      "Our approach identifies genes in NCD LUADs that are mutated more or less frequently than expected based on chance. To identify over- and under-mutated genes, we plotted the observed frequency of samples with non-synonymous mutations in each gene against that gene’s size (number of base pairs). Assuming the probability of mutation was approximately equal for every base pair in an expressed gene, the background mutation rate was determined by regressing the mutational frequency of each gene against gene size (Fig. 1 ). The distance of each gene to the regression line was then determined, and this standardized residual was compared across all genes. Negative and positive residual values indicate under-mutated and over-mutated genes, respectively. We scored a gene as over-mutated and under positive selection if it was ≥ 2 standard deviations above the neutral line. Similarly, a gene was considered under-mutated (i.e., conserved) and under stabilizing selection if it was ≥ 2 standard deviations below the neural line. In other words, our primary metric for natural selection was based on whether mutations to a gene were less (stabilizing selection) or more (directional selection) frequent than expected by chance. Fig. 1 Converting gene mutation number into evolutionary selection. The number of mutations within the cohort are plotted against the gene size (number of base pairs). Using linear regression, a neutral line was established for an expected number of mutations for each gene size with no evolutionary selection (i.e., “passenger mutations”). When the number of mutations exceeded 2 standard deviations above the neutral line, the mutation was considered under positive evolutionary selection. Genes in which the number of mutations was 2 standard deviations below the neutral line were considered “conserved.”\n",

However, as discussed in prior publications [ 9 , 10 ], variation in the observed mutation rates of individual genes resulting from decreased fitness with loss of the cell due to evolutionary selection could be interpreted as the result of intra-genomic variation in mutation rates. For example, Monroe et al. [ 17 ], observed that, in Arabidopsis thaliana “genes subject to stronger purifying selection have a lower mutation rate.” In our hypothesis, important regions of the genome are observed to be mutated less often [ 18 ] because such mutations reduce fitness and proliferation and, therefore, not transmitted across generations. Furthermore, the retention or loss of a gene mutation via natural selection (even if the underlying mutation rate is different) fundamentally depends on its contribution to fitness. Finally, a prior study that reported higher expression levels in over-mutated genes was based on comparisons of expression from cell lines to mutation data from clinical samples [ 16 ], which represent very different environmental selection forces. In contrast, here we use expression and mutation data from the same clinical source and find the expression of conserved genes is, on average, 16-fold higher in normal tissue compared to normal tissue expression in genes found to have selected mutations in the cancer cells.\n",

The 313 non-EGFR/KRAS/BRAF patients were classified as no common driver (NCD). Somatic mutations were downloaded from the TCGA PanCancer Atlas [ 12 ]. Tumor and normal sequence alignment files used to calculate individual base coverage were downloaded from Genome Data Commons. A base was considered sufficiently covered if the depth of coverage was ≥ 14 in tumor sample and ≥ 8 in normal samples as has been previously described: https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1695394 . The fraction of each gene’s protein coding bases (using the longest RefSeq transcript) covered by sufficient sequence data was calculated for each sample using the Negative Storage Model [ 13 ]. Gene-level depth of coverage was then determined by calculating the number of bases sufficiently covered by sequencing for each of the RefSeq coding genes (with 25 base-pair flanking regions). This procedure measures the fraction of each gene (longest transcript) covered by sequencing data. To address sequencing artifacts that falsely decrease mutation rates, we excluded genes with low average depth of coverage frequency (< 50%) and those with errors in the RefSeq gene model.\n",

      "Our approach identifies genes in NCD LUADs that are mutated more or less frequently than expected based on chance. To identify over- and under-mutated genes, we plotted the observed frequency of samples with non-synonymous mutations in each gene against that gene’s size (number of base pairs). Assuming the probability of mutation was approximately equal for every base pair in an expressed gene, the background mutation rate was determined by regressing the mutational frequency of each gene against gene size (Fig. 1 ). The distance of each gene to the regression line was then determined, and this standardized residual was compared across all genes. Negative and positive residual values indicate under-mutated and over-mutated genes, respectively. We scored a gene as over-mutated and under positive selection if it was ≥ 2 standard deviations above the neutral line. Similarly, a gene was considered under-mutated (i.e., conserved) and under stabilizing selection if it was ≥ 2 standard deviations below the neural line. In other words, our primary metric for natural selection was based on whether mutations to a gene were less (stabilizing selection) or more (directional selection) frequent than expected by chance. Fig. 1 Converting gene mutation number into evolutionary selection. The number of mutations within the cohort are plotted against the gene size (number of base pairs). Using linear regression, a neutral line was established for an expected number of mutations for each gene size with no evolutionary selection (i.e., “passenger mutations”). When the number of mutations exceeded 2 standard deviations above the neutral line, the mutation was considered under positive evolutionary selection.

We find a clear relationship between epigenetic and genetic inheritance as genes with evolution selected mutations frequently also show significant increased or decreased expression. The findings suggest an evolutionary equivalency and that epigenetic changes likely precede mutations changes. That is, when sustained increased or decreased gene expression optimizes fitness, a gain or loss of function mutation will equivalently maximize fitness. Furthermore, genes highly expressed in normal tissue are often conserved suggesting this core set of genes is necessary for optimal function of both normal and malignant cells.\n",

      "Analogous to loss of eyes in the cavefish, lung cancer cells turn off differentiated functions (e.g., oxygen transport, cilia movement, surfactant synthesis), and cell–cell interactions governing 3-dimensional tissue organization that provide no fitness benefit. While these properties contribute to whole tissue functioning, from the perspective of the evolving cancer cells, they consume needed resources while providing no direct fitness benefit. An interesting component of the “de-differentiating” phenotype is loss of genes associated with circadian entrainment. Normal somatic cells are subject to circadian coordination of physiological processes, including immune function [ 54 ]. Maintaining normal activity at night, when normal cells are quiescent, appears to provide an evolutionary benefit that outweighs the metabolic cost. This is consistent with the observation that breast cancers accelerate their growth during sleep [ 55 ].\n",

Indeed, genes associated with the canonical MAPK, WNT, TGFB, PI3K, PTEN, and AKT pathways are generally down regulated and do not show evidence of evolutionary selection for mutations or conservation. However, in the absence of clear molecular drivers, we note that there is remarkably extensive evolutionary selection on ligand- and voltage-gated ion channels and ion transporters. Prior studies have shown that reductions in the negative transmembrane potential is common in cells undergoing rapid mitosis, including cancer cells, and that manipulating this potential can alter the proliferation of cancer cells [ 23 , 64 – 66 ]. Thus, we hypothesize the net result of changes in ion channels/transport is a reduction in the transmembrane potential that sustains proliferation of NCD LUAD.

Prior theoretical investigations have suggested targeting conserved genes may be equally or more effective than the traditional approach which targets gene mutations [ 53 ]. Furthermore, changes in expression, as noted above, can provide potential information on the relative fitness benefit of mutated or conserved genes. For example, a conserved gene that has significantly increased expression is probably critical for cancer cell fitness and an ideal clinical target. Similarly, genes that are frequently mutated with corresponding significant changes in expression (up or down) are also likely to be highly valuable targets for therapy.\n",

By integrating expression and mutational data, we see clear dynamical connections among these mechanisms of inheritance within the evolutionary arc of each cancer. Thus, for example, the strong association between expression changes and selected gene mutations suggests gain and loss of function mutations often represent a “hard wiring” of genes that have already been epigenetically selected for consistent increased or decreased expression. Furthermore, widespread conservation of genes associated with transcription control, ribosomes, homeobox, and RNA Polymerase II demonstrates the critical role of translational control in evolution of the malignant phenotype in NCD LUADs. These observations suggest NCD LUADs evolve through an interconnected network of genetic, epigenetic, and ecological pathways.\n",

Content: <p> <strong> SPNeodeath </strong> dataset includes births and deaths of infants during the neonatal period from São Paulo city between 2012 and 2018, containing more than 1.4 million records. The dataset was created from SINASC and SIM Brazilian information systems for births and deaths respectively. SINASC comprises information about demographic and epidemiological data for the infant, mother, prenatal care and childbirth. SIM collects information about mortality, and it is used as the basis for the calculation of vital statistics, such as neonatal mortality rate. SIM was only used to label records from SINASC, when the death happened until 28 days of life. <strong> SPNeodeath </strong> has 23 variables with socioeconomic maternal condition features, maternal obstetrics features, newborn related features and previous care related features, besides a label feature describing if the subject survived, or not, after 28 days of life.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract.

Originally, the files are on DBF format, a standard database file used by dBASE database management system. In order to read the DBF files and convert then to CSV format, a library from R programming language was used.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Then the CSV files were loaded into a development environment using Python programming language, and by using Pandas library, all data manipulation was performed. The <strong> SPNeoDeath </strong> dataset is available in CSV format. </p> <p id=\"para0012\"> SINASC and SIM datasets are not initially linked, so to associate birth and death records, a simple combination between the datasets was performed using a common variable for both systems, Number of Live Birth Statement (NUMERODN). Even though filling out the DNV and the DO is mandatory, there is a significant deficiency in data quality due to many situations such as loss when sending the data from hospitals to the city health offices, fields filled with incorrect values and unknown information by the person answering.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: </p> <p id=\"para0013\"> After the combination, a new field was added in the resultant data set to label the samples as being a neonatal death (deaths occurred before the first 28 days of life) or not. This was achieved by calculating the difference between the birth date (from SINASC) and the death date (from SIM). </p> <p id=\"para0014\"> SIM data are applied just for labelling purposes, so for each SINASC record, SIM data were used to label the sample as dead or alive class, makingit possible to construct a big annotated dataset. After the linkage between SIM and SINASC, the key used on the joining operation was removed from the resultant dataset, as well as many other fields that could be used to re-identify individuals. As SIM data is used just to allow data set labelling, after this process all SIM fields were also removed from the final dataset.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: </p> <p id=\"para0015\"> As mentioned, in the context of Brazilian public health data, occurrence of missing or inconsistent data is common and it mostly happens due to the incorrect filling of handwritten forms. Rows having fields with inconsistent values were removed, and a general approach for demographic studies to deal with missing values were used based on approaches of similar studies [ <a aria-describedby=\"bib0003\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#bib0003\"> [3] </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"bib0004\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#bib0004\"> [4] </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"bib0005\" aria-expanded=\"false\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#bib0005\"> [5] </a> ].\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: All the features had less than 12% of missing values and basically, two different techniques were applied: for non-categorical features, with continuous numerical values, the mean value for this feature in the dataset is calculated, and the feature is filled with this value; whereas features with categorical values (discrete values) are filled using the most frequent value for this feature in the dataset (the mode value). </p> <p id=\"para0016\"> This paper uses publicly available data (SIM and SINASC) that has been de-identified and was deemed exempt from approval from a human research ethics committee. </p> <p id=\"para0017\"> This research was supported by Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (Process no: OPP1201970) and Ministry of Health of Brazil, through the National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq) (Process no: 443774/2018-8).

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: <p> A specific cell surface glycan enables the identification of breast cancer stem cells and contributes to their function. </p> <p> We pursued the hypothesis that specific glycans can be used to distinguish breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) and influence their function. Comparison of CSCs and non-CSCs from multiple breast cancer models revealed that CSCs are distinguished by expression of α2,3 sialylated core2 O-linked glycans. We identified a lectin, SLBR-N, which binds to O-linked α2,3 sialic acids, that was able to enrich for CSCs in vitro and in vivo. This O-glycan is expressed on CD44 and promotes its interaction with hyaluronic acid, facilitating CD44 signaling and CSC properties. In contrast, FUT3, which contributes to sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) production, is preferentially expressed in the non-CSC population, and it antagonizes CSC function.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Collectively, our data indicate that SLBR-N can be more efficient at enriching for CSCs than CD44 itself because its use avoids the issues of CD44 splicing and glycan status. These data also reveal how differential glycosylation influences CSC fate. </p> <p> Solid tumors such as breast and other carcinomas are characterized by extensive heterogeneity in the cell populations that comprise them ( <a aria-describedby=\"R1\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R1\"> <em> 1 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R2\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R2\"> <em> 2 </em> </a> ). This heterogeneity exists not only between tumor and stromal cells but also within tumor cells themselves, a finding that has been made apparent by recent single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies on many different carcinomas ( <a aria-describedby=\"R3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R3\"> <em> 3 </em> </a> – <a aria-describedby=\"R5\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R5\"> <em> 5 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: The concept of intratumor heterogeneity is highly relevant because distinct tumor cell populations differ in many aspects including their differentiation status, response to therapy, and ability to initiate a recurrent tumor ( <a aria-describedby=\"R6\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R6\"> <em> 6 </em> </a> ). In this context, considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that distinct populations of tumor cells with the ability to resist therapy and initiate new tumors are characterized by properties associated with stem cells ( <a aria-describedby=\"R6\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R6\"> <em> 6 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R7\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R7\"> <em> 7 </em> </a> ). For this reason, they are often referred to as tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Although the term “CSC” has been used to describe a range of cell populations that share similar properties such as the ability to form spheroids in three-dimensional culture and to resist chemo- and radiation therapy, it is evident that cells of this nature are enriched in more aggressive tumors and contribute to their aggressive behavior ( <a aria-describedby=\"R7\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R7\"> <em> 7 </em> </a> ). On the basis of this information, there is intense interest in identifying specific markers that distinguish CSC populations from their less aggressive counterparts and to exploit such markers for therapeutic targeting. </p> <p> We hypothesized that the cell surface glycome provides a rich resource for the identification of specific glycans that distinguish CSCs from other tumor cells. Cell surface glycans are highly complex, with various cores and termini regulated by multiple enzymes.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Moreover, different sets of structures can be displayed on protein N-linked and O-linked glycans, as well as glycolipids. There is a literature that spans decades on glycosylation differences between normal and transformed cells as highlighted by the more recent finding that the carbohydrate antigen CA19-9 [sialyl Lewis A (sLeA)] is highly expressed in aggressive pancreatic tumors with minimal expression in normal pancreatic tissue ( <a aria-describedby=\"R8\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R8\"> <em> 8 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R9\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R9\"> <em> 9 </em> </a> ). Moreover, glycans can be effective therapeutic targets. For example, targeting a glycosylated form of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with drug-conjugated antibodies in breast cancer promoted immune reactivation and a “bystander-killing effect” with minimal toxicity to normal tissues ( <a aria-describedby=\"R10\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R10\"> <em> 10 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Although previous studies have investigated glycosyltransferases expressed in CSCs ( <a aria-describedby=\"R11\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R11\"> <em> 11 </em> </a> ), glycans are not used routinely as markers to enrich for CSCs in heterogeneous tumor populations, and relatively little is known about how specific glycans promote CSC properties. Thus, it is essential to identify the unique and targetable glycans and glycosylated proteins expressed in CSC populations and to assess how protein glycoforms regulate CSC functions. To achieve this goal, we used unbiased approaches to identify specific glycans that distinguish breast cancer cells with CSC properties from other tumor cells, and we investigated how these glycans affect CSC function. </p> <p> Initially, we sought to identify specific glycans that distinguish populations of breast cancer cells enriched for CSC properties from the bulk population.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: For this purpose, we used human mammary luminal epithelial (HMLE) cells generated by the Weinberg laboratory that had been transformed with H-Ras (HMLER) ( <a aria-describedby=\"R12\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R12\"> <em> 12 </em> </a> ). A previously published study from our laboratory had shown that HMLER cells could be sorted on the basis of the expression of CD104 and CD24 into a distinct population that is mesenchymal and enriched for CSC properties (CD104 <sup> low </sup> /CD24 <sup> low </sup> ) and a more epithelial population that has diminished CSC properties (CD104 <sup> high </sup> /CD24 <sup> high </sup> ) ( <a aria-describedby=\"R13\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R13\"> <em> 13 </em> </a> ). In this context, we define CSC properties as the ability to form mammospheres and resist chemotherapy as demonstrated in the previous publication.\n",

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: CSCs express the core2 α2,3 sialoglycan initiated by GCNT1 and sialylated by the ST3GAL enzymes. Non-CSCs express N-linked sLeX driven by FUT3. </p> <p> We analyzed the glycomes of the CSC and non-CSC HMLER populations using our dual-color lectin microarray technology ( <a aria-describedby=\"R14\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R14\"> <em> 14 </em> </a> ). In brief, equal amounts of orthogonally labeled fluorescent samples and a mixed reference containing all samples were analyzed on the array, which contains &gt;100 lectin probes. For more information, see tables S1 and S2. Although few significant differences between the two populations were observed, a subtle but clear difference was seen in O-linked α2,3 sialic acids [lectins: SK678, SLBR-H (n.s., not significant), and SLBR-N (n.s.)], which were enriched in CSC cells, and N-linked α2,6 sialic acids, which were enriched in non-CSC cells ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1B </a> and fig.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: S1B; for complete heatmap, see fig. S1A). Subsequently, RNA-seq was performed on the same populations to assess potential differences in glycosyltransferase expression ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1C </a> ). We observed that the CSC-enriched population displayed increased expression of the core2 β-1,6- <em> N </em> -acetylglucosaminyltransferase-1 (GCNT1) and α2,3 sialyltransferases [ST3GAL2, ST3GAL5, and ST3GAL6 (n.s.)] and decreased expression of the α2,6 sialyltransferases (ST6GAL1) compared with the non–CSC-enriched population. The differential expression of these glycosyltransferases correlated with the lectin microarray data, explaining the alterations in glycan structures observed between the CSC-enriched and non–CSC-enriched populations. We also observed that the α1,3 fucosyltransferase FUT3, which is linked to the sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) N-glycan, was preferentially expressed in the non–CSC-enriched population.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: </p> <p> The lectin microarray and RNA-seq data provided key information that enabled us to investigate the putative glycan differences in more detail. Specifically, we made use of the lectins identified by the lectin microarray to characterize sialylation differences between the CSC- and non–CSC-enriched HMLER populations by flow cytometry and observed the most significant difference with SLBR-N, which is derived from the bacterium <em> Streptococcus gordonii </em> and binds preferentially to core2 O-linked α2,3 sialoglycans on glycoproteins ( <a aria-describedby=\"R15\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R15\"> <em> 15 </em> </a> ). These glycans are initiated by the glycosyltransferase GCNT1 and are further modified by other glycosyltranferases including terminal α2,3 sialylation by ST3GAL2, ST3GAL5, and ST3GAL6, which we confirmed to be enriched in the CSC population by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; fig. S1C).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Notably, SLBR-N exhibited significantly higher binding to the CSC-enriched population compared with the non–CSC-enriched population ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1D </a> ). In contrast, no such difference was observed with SLBR-H, which prefers sialylated core1 and core2 O-glycans. Also, the SK678 lectin, which recognizes other core2 α2,3 sialoglycan structures, did not select for the CSC-enriched population, although it showed significant binding in the lectin microarray ( <a aria-describedby=\"R15\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R15\"> <em> 15 </em> </a> ). The SNA (Sambucus Nigra Lectin) lectin, which detects α2,6 sialic acids produced by ST6GAL1, exhibited preferential binding to the non–CSC-enriched population ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1E </a> and fig. S1C), consistent with our glycomic and transcriptomic datasets. Our RNA-seq data on FUT3 prompted us to compare the expression of sLeX between the two populations.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Although a specific lectin that detects α1,3 fucose is not available, we used the HECA-452 antibody for flow cytometry because it is specific for N-linked sLeX, which is fucosylated by FUT3. HECA-452 bound much more significantly to the non–CSC-enriched populations, and FUT3 expression was enhanced in the non-CSC population as assessed by qPCR ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1F </a> and fig. S1C). Last, we thought it was important to compare the expression of sLeA, also known as CA19-9, between the two populations because this glycan has been implicated in highly aggressive pancreatic cancer ( <a aria-describedby=\"R9\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R9\"> <em> 9 </em> </a> ). The breast cancer–derived CSC- and non–CSC-enriched populations did not significantly differ in their expression of CA19-9, suggesting the glycome patterns of the breast and pancreatic CSCs are different (fig. S1D).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Together, our unbiased approaches reveal that the CSC- and non–CSC-enriched populations exhibit significant differences in glycosylation. Specifically, the non-CSC population is distinguished by higher levels of α2,6 sialosides and the expression of sLeX ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1G </a> ). In contrast, the CSC-enriched population is characterized by increased expression of a core2 O-linked α2,3 sialoglycan detected by the SLBR-N lectin. </p> <p> To assess whether the SLBR-N lectin can be used to enrich for CSCs in heterogeneous cell populations, we sorted HMLER cells and another breast cancer cell line, HCC1806, using this lectin and obtained distinct SLBR-N <sup> high </sup> and SLBR-N <sup> low </sup> populations (fig.

      "Section Title: Abstract | RESULTS | The SLBR-N lectin enriches for cells with stem cell properties in vitro and in vivo. Content: We used a variant of MDA-MB-231 cells, termed TE3 cells, that were selected for their CSC-like properties ( <a aria-describedby=\"R17\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R17\"> <em> 17 </em> </a> ). We observed by SLBR-N staining that the TE3 variant was enriched in core2 O-linked α2,3 sialoglycans compared with the MDA-MB-231 cells ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F2\"> Fig. 2H </a> ). We confirmed that SLBR-N identifies an O-linked α2,3 sialoglycan by treating TE3 cells with neuraminidase S, an α2,3-specific sialidase, and PNGaseF, which removes N-linked glycans ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F2\"> Fig. 2, I and J </a> ). Diminishing the expression of a single ST3Gal enzyme did not significantly alter the expression of the SLBR-N ligand (fig. S2, G and H), however, most likely because of the compensatory nature of the α2,3 sialyltransferases ( <a aria-describedby=\"R18\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R18\"> <em> 18 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | RESULTS | The SLBR-N lectin enriches for cells with stem cell properties in vitro and in vivo.

Knockdown of GCNT1 did not diminish the ability of SLBR-H to bind to the CSCs, because it also can bind to core1 structures, but it did diminish SK678 binding (fig.

To assess the contribution of CD44s to HA binding, we depleted CD44 expression using short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs; <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F5\"> Fig. 5, B and C </a> ).

This lectin can be used to enrich for cells with stem cell properties in heterogeneous populations of tumor cells including PDX models of breast cancer. These conclusions are buttressed by RNA-seq data indicating that the expression of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of this glycan, including GCNT1 and the ST3GAL glycosyltransferases, is significantly elevated in CSC populations compared with non-CSC populations.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract.

Much of the work on this area has focused on mucins, heavily O-glycosylated proteins that express few N-glycans, that have been implicated in the behavior of breast and other cancers, including the function of CSCs ( <a aria-describedby=\"R26\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R26\"> <em> 26 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R27\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R27\"> <em> 27 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: The O-linked core2 α2,3 sialoglycan that we have identified is not linked to a mucin, but its ability to modify the function of essential proteins such as CD44 underlies its contribution to CSC function. Although a previous study had shown that GCNT1, the enzyme that synthesizes the branched core2 glycan structure, contributes to the function of tumor-initiating cells in breast cancer ( <a aria-describedby=\"R28\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R28\"> <em> 28 </em> </a> ), we argue that it is the terminal α2,3 sialylation that is the critical effector of CSC function. Sialylation is known to affect the function of tumor cells, including CSCs, and it is considered a potential therapeutic target ( <a aria-describedby=\"R29\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R29\"> <em> 29 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Of note, α2,6 sialylation mediated by ST6GAL1, primarily on N-linked glycans, has been implicated in the function of pancreatic and ovarian CSCs ( <a aria-describedby=\"R29\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R29\"> <em> 29 </em> </a> ). Our results differ markedly from these studies because our data revealed that α2,6 sialylation ST6GAL1 expression is associated with a non-CSC population and that α2,3 sialylation of O-linked glycans is the critical effector of CSC function. The discrepancy between our data and other studies may relate to differences in the cancers studied or other factors that remain to be determined. Nonetheless, the dichotomy of α2,3 sialylation of O-glycans and α2,6 sialylation of N-glycans that we observed between CSCs and non-CSCs in breast cancer is notable, and it highlights the specificity of sialylation in affecting CSC function.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: </p> <p> A major finding in this study is that CD44s expresses the O-linked, core2 α2,3 sialoglycan in breast CSCs and that this glycan is necessary for the ability of CD44s to interact with HA. Although CD44 expresses N- and O-linked glycans, most work has focused on the contribution of N-linked glycans to HA binding ( <a aria-describedby=\"R22\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R22\"> <em> 22 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R23\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R23\"> <em> 23 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R30\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R30\"> <em> 30 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R31\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R31\"> <em> 31 </em> </a> ). A key study in this regard by Skelton <em> et al. </em> ( <a aria-describedby=\"R23\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R23\"> <em> 23 </em> </a> ) demonstrated the role of glycosylation in regulating CD44-HA binding and the contribution of complex N-linked glycans to this binding.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: The study also indicated that O-linked glycans may be important based on the mutational analysis of Ser-Gly motifs in the membrane proximal domain. Subsequent studies have refined the nature of N-linked glycosylation on CD44, including CD44s, but much less is known about O-glycosylation ( <a aria-describedby=\"R32\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R32\"> <em> 32 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R33\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R33\"> <em> 33 </em> </a> ). Recently, Mereiter and colleagues ( <a aria-describedby=\"R34\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R34\"> <em> 34 </em> </a> ) found that truncation of CD44 O-glycans promotes interaction with HA in gastric cancer, suggesting that a variety of glycans can mediate this interaction; however, more work must be done to better understand the impact of O-glycosylation in this process.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: On the basis of the compensatory nature of α2,3 sialyltransferases and the technical constraints in diminishing this glycan, we targeted the α2,3 sialoglycan by knocking down the core2 synthase, GCNT1. Future studies delving into the specific structure of this glycan on CD44s would benefit from glycoproteomic analyses and O-glycosylation site mutants to better understand the mechanisms by which this α2,3 sialoglycan promotes the interaction with HA. The strength of our finding is that we identified a specific O-linked glycan that modifies CD44s and demonstrated that it contributes to the ability of CD44 to bind HA and facilitate breast CSC properties. </p> <p> We conclude from our data that the ability of core2 α2,3 sialoglycan to promote the interaction of CD44s with HA underlies the ability of CD44s to promote CSC functions.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Although the ability of CD44 to bind HA has been implicated in tumorigenicity and possibly CSC function ( <a aria-describedby=\"R35\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R35\"> <em> 35 </em> </a> ), the contribution of CD44s glycosylation to these processes had not been established. An important contribution of our findings is that we link CD44s glycosylation and HA binding to signaling events that have been shown to be critical for the function of breast CSCs. In a recent collaborative study, we demonstrated that the breast CSC state is regulated by alternative splicing of CD44 and that CD44s determines CSC function ( <a aria-describedby=\"R20\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R20\"> <em> 20 </em> </a> ). This study also revealed that CD44s interacts with PDGFRβ and activates a PDGFRβ/STAT3 signaling pathway that contributes to CSC function.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: In the current study, we advance our understanding of this mechanism by demonstrating that it is dependent on a core2 α2,3 sialylated glycoform of CD44s. </p> <p> An unexpected finding in this study is that FUT3, a key enzyme in the genesis of sLeX, antagonizes CSC function. Both FUT3 and sLeX have been implicated in breast cancer progression and correlate with lower overall survival of patients ( <a aria-describedby=\"R24\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R24\"> <em> 24 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R25\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R25\"> <em> 25 </em> </a> ). sLeX is the main ligand for E-selectin, which is expressed on endothelial cells, and the binding of sLeX on tumors to E-selectin on endothelial cells contributes to extravasation from the vasculature during metastasis ( <a aria-describedby=\"R24\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R24\"> <em> 24 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Our data reveal that sLeX antagonizes CSC function, including the function of CD44, and they highlight distinct differences in glycosylation between cells with stem cell properties and other populations of tumor cells. It is worth noting in this context that CD44s in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expresses N-linked sLeX, a glycoform termed “HCELL” (hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand) and that this glycan actually promotes stemness in these cells ( <a aria-describedby=\"R36\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R36\"> <em> 36 </em> </a> ). The contrast with our data with respect to sLeX function on CD44s is notable, and it suggests key differences between hematopoietic and breast CSCs with respect to how glycosylation affects CD44 function. </p> <p> Our work also highlights the confounding nature of CD44 as a breast CSC marker.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | DISCUSSION. Content: CD44 was identified as a marker for the breast CSC population and was subsequently used to select for CSC populations in other cancer types ( <a aria-describedby=\"R16\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R16\"> <em> 16 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R37\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R37\"> <em> 37 </em> </a> – <a aria-describedby=\"R40\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R40\"> <em> 40 </em> </a> ).

      "Section Title: Abstract | DISCUSSION. Content: Not only is CD44 splice variant expression a determinant of CSC fate and function, but glycan expression on CD44 itself can alter its function ( <a aria-describedby=\"R20\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R20\"> <em> 20 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R44\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R44\"> <em> 44 </em> </a> ). We argue that the SLBR-N lectin acts as a more efficient CSC marker compared with conventional CD44 <sup> + </sup> /CD24 <sup> − </sup> staining pattern because it enriches for cells with CSC properties while removing the confounding issues of CD44 splice forms and glycan status. </p> <p> In summary, this study has identified a distinct glycan that distinguishes breast CSCs from non-CSCs.

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: <p> We pursued the hypothesis that specific glycans can be used to distinguish breast cancer stem cells (CSCs) and influence their function. Comparison of CSCs and non-CSCs from multiple breast cancer models revealed that CSCs are distinguished by expression of α2,3 sialylated core2 O-linked glycans. We identified a lectin, SLBR-N, which binds to O-linked α2,3 sialic acids, that was able to enrich for CSCs in vitro and in vivo. This O-glycan is expressed on CD44 and promotes its interaction with hyaluronic acid, facilitating CD44 signaling and CSC properties. In contrast, FUT3, which contributes to sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) production, is preferentially expressed in the non-CSC population, and it antagonizes CSC function. Collectively, our data indicate that SLBR-N can be more efficient at enriching for CSCs than CD44 itself because its use avoids the issues of CD44 splicing and glycan status.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: These data also reveal how differential glycosylation influences CSC fate. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: INTRODUCTION. Content: <p> Solid tumors such as breast and other carcinomas are characterized by extensive heterogeneity in the cell populations that comprise them ( <a aria-describedby=\"R1\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R1\"> <em> 1 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R2\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R2\"> <em> 2 </em> </a> ). This heterogeneity exists not only between tumor and stromal cells but also within tumor cells themselves, a finding that has been made apparent by recent single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) studies on many different carcinomas ( <a aria-describedby=\"R3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R3\"> <em> 3 </em> </a> – <a aria-describedby=\"R5\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R5\"> <em> 5 </em> </a> ). The concept of intratumor heterogeneity is highly relevant because distinct tumor cell populations differ in many aspects including their differentiation status, response to therapy, and ability to initiate a recurrent tumor ( <a aria-describedby=\"R6\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R6\"> <em> 6 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: INTRODUCTION. Content: In this context, considerable evidence supports the hypothesis that distinct populations of tumor cells with the ability to resist therapy and initiate new tumors are characterized by properties associated with stem cells ( <a aria-describedby=\"R6\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R6\"> <em> 6 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R7\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R7\"> <em> 7 </em> </a> ). For this reason, they are often referred to as tumor-initiating cells or cancer stem cells (CSCs). Although the term “CSC” has been used to describe a range of cell populations that share similar properties such as the ability to form spheroids in three-dimensional culture and to resist chemo- and radiation therapy, it is evident that cells of this nature are enriched in more aggressive tumors and contribute to their aggressive behavior ( <a aria-describedby=\"R7\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R7\"> <em> 7 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: INTRODUCTION. Content: On the basis of this information, there is intense interest in identifying specific markers that distinguish CSC populations from their less aggressive counterparts and to exploit such markers for therapeutic targeting. </p> <p> We hypothesized that the cell surface glycome provides a rich resource for the identification of specific glycans that distinguish CSCs from other tumor cells. Cell surface glycans are highly complex, with various cores and termini regulated by multiple enzymes. Moreover, different sets of structures can be displayed on protein N-linked and O-linked glycans, as well as glycolipids.\n",
      "Section Title: INTRODUCTION. Content: There is a literature that spans decades on glycosylation differences between normal and transformed cells as highlighted by the more recent finding that the carbohydrate antigen CA19-9 [sialyl Lewis A (sLeA)] is highly expressed in aggressive pancreatic tumors with minimal expression in normal pancreatic tissue ( <a aria-describedby=\"R8\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R8\"> <em> 8 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R9\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R9\"> <em> 9 </em> </a> ). Moreover, glycans can be effective therapeutic targets. For example, targeting a glycosylated form of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) with drug-conjugated antibodies in breast cancer promoted immune reactivation and a “bystander-killing effect” with minimal toxicity to normal tissues ( <a aria-describedby=\"R10\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R10\"> <em> 10 </em> </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: INTRODUCTION. Content: Although previous studies have investigated glycosyltransferases expressed in CSCs ( <a aria-describedby=\"R11\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R11\"> <em> 11 </em> </a> ), glycans are not used routinely as markers to enrich for CSCs in heterogeneous tumor populations, and relatively little is known about how specific glycans promote CSC properties. Thus, it is essential to identify the unique and targetable glycans and glycosylated proteins expressed in CSC populations and to assess how protein glycoforms regulate CSC functions. To achieve this goal, we used unbiased approaches to identify specific glycans that distinguish breast cancer cells with CSC properties from other tumor cells, and we investigated how these glycans affect CSC function. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: RESULTS | α2,3 sialylation characterizes CSC-enriched populations of breast tumor cells. Content: <p> Initially, we sought to identify specific glycans that distinguish populations of breast cancer cells enriched for CSC properties from the bulk population. For this purpose, we used human mammary luminal epithelial (HMLE) cells generated by the Weinberg laboratory that had been transformed with H-Ras (HMLER) ( <a aria-describedby=\"R12\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R12\"> <em> 12 </em> </a> ). A previously published study from our laboratory had shown that HMLER cells could be sorted on the basis of the expression of CD104 and CD24 into a distinct population that is mesenchymal and enriched for CSC properties (CD104 <sup> low </sup> /CD24 <sup> low </sup> ) and a more epithelial population that has diminished CSC properties (CD104 <sup> high </sup> /CD24 <sup> high </sup> ) ( <a aria-describedby=\"R13\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R13\"> <em> 13 </em> </a> ).\n",

The differential expression of these glycosyltransferases correlated with the lectin microarray data, explaining the alterations in glycan structures observed between the CSC-enriched and non–CSC-enriched populations. We also observed that the α1,3 fucosyltransferase FUT3, which is linked to the sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) N-glycan, was preferentially expressed in the non–CSC-enriched population. </p> <p> The lectin microarray and RNA-seq data provided key information that enabled us to investigate the putative glycan differences in more detail.\n",
      "Section Title: RESULTS | α2,3 sialylation characterizes CSC-enriched populations of breast tumor cells. Content: Specifically, we made use of the lectins identified by the lectin microarray to characterize sialylation differences between the CSC- and non–CSC-enriched HMLER populations by flow cytometry and observed the most significant difference with SLBR-N, which is derived from the bacterium <em> Streptococcus gordonii </em> and binds preferentially to core2 O-linked α2,3 sialoglycans on glycoproteins ( <a aria-describedby=\"R15\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R15\"> <em> 15 </em> </a> ). These glycans are initiated by the glycosyltransferase GCNT1 and are further modified by other glycosyltranferases including terminal α2,3 sialylation by ST3GAL2, ST3GAL5, and ST3GAL6, which we confirmed to be enriched in the CSC population by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR; fig. S1C). Notably, SLBR-N exhibited significantly higher binding to the CSC-enriched population compared with the non–CSC-enriched population ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1D </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: RESULTS | α2,3 sialylation characterizes CSC-enriched populations of breast tumor cells. Content: In contrast, no such difference was observed with SLBR-H, which prefers sialylated core1 and core2 O-glycans. Also, the SK678 lectin, which recognizes other core2 α2,3 sialoglycan structures, did not select for the CSC-enriched population, although it showed significant binding in the lectin microarray ( <a aria-describedby=\"R15\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R15\"> <em> 15 </em> </a> ). The SNA (Sambucus Nigra Lectin) lectin, which detects α2,6 sialic acids produced by ST6GAL1, exhibited preferential binding to the non–CSC-enriched population ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1E </a> and fig. S1C), consistent with our glycomic and transcriptomic datasets. Our RNA-seq data on FUT3 prompted us to compare the expression of sLeX between the two populations. Although a specific lectin that detects α1,3 fucose is not available, we used the HECA-452 antibody for flow cytometry because it is specific for N-linked sLeX, which is fucosylated by FUT3.\n",
      "Section Title: RESULTS | α2,3 sialylation characterizes CSC-enriched populations of breast tumor cells. Content: HECA-452 bound much more significantly to the non–CSC-enriched populations, and FUT3 expression was enhanced in the non-CSC population as assessed by qPCR ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#F1\"> Fig. 1F </a> and fig. S1C). Last, we thought it was important to compare the expression of sLeA, also known as CA19-9, between the two populations because this glycan has been implicated in highly aggressive pancreatic cancer ( <a aria-describedby=\"R9\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R9\"> <em> 9 </em> </a> ). The breast cancer–derived CSC- and non–CSC-enriched populations did not significantly differ in their expression of CA19-9, suggesting the glycome patterns of the breast and pancreatic CSCs are different (fig. S1D). Together, our unbiased approaches reveal that the CSC- and non–CSC-enriched populations exhibit significant differences in glycosylation.\n",

This interaction of CD44 with HA is facilitated by many factors including N-glycosylation of CD44 ( <a aria-describedby=\"R22\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R22\"> <em> 22 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R23\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R23\"> <em> 23 </em> </a> ), but less is known about the contribution of specific O-glycans to this interaction.

This lectin can be used to enrich for cells with stem cell properties in heterogeneous populations of tumor cells including PDX models of breast cancer. These conclusions are buttressed by RNA-seq data indicating that the expression of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of this glycan, including GCNT1 and the ST3GAL glycosyltransferases, is significantly elevated in CSC populations compared with non-CSC populations. We also demonstrate that this O-linked α2,3 sialoglycan is expressed on CD44s, a splice variant of CD44 critical for CSC function ( <a aria-describedby=\"R20\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R20\"> <em> 20 </em> </a> ), and that it is necessary for mediating the interaction of CD44s with HA and signaling events that sustain CSC function.\n",

Sialylation is known to affect the function of tumor cells, including CSCs, and it is considered a potential therapeutic target ( <a aria-describedby=\"R29\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R29\"> <em> 29 </em> </a> ).

The discrepancy between our data and other studies may relate to differences in the cancers studied or other factors that remain to be determined. Nonetheless, the dichotomy of α2,3 sialylation of O-glycans and α2,6 sialylation of N-glycans that we observed between CSCs and non-CSCs in breast cancer is notable, and it highlights the specificity of sialylation in affecting CSC function. </p> <p> A major finding in this study is that CD44s expresses the O-linked, core2 α2,3 sialoglycan in breast CSCs and that this glycan is necessary for the ability of CD44s to interact with HA.\n",

Content: Both FUT3 and sLeX have been implicated in breast cancer progression and correlate with lower overall survival of patients ( <a aria-describedby=\"R24\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R24\"> <em> 24 </em> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"R25\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R25\"> <em> 25 </em> </a> ). sLeX is the main ligand for E-selectin, which is expressed on endothelial cells, and the binding of sLeX on tumors to E-selectin on endothelial cells contributes to extravasation from the vasculature during metastasis ( <a aria-describedby=\"R24\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R24\"> <em> 24 </em> </a> ). Our data reveal that sLeX antagonizes CSC function, including the function of CD44, and they highlight distinct differences in glycosylation between cells with stem cell properties and other populations of tumor cells.\n",
      "Section Title: DISCUSSION. Content: It is worth noting in this context that CD44s in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expresses N-linked sLeX, a glycoform termed “HCELL” (hematopoietic cell E-/L-selectin ligand) and that this glycan actually promotes stemness in these cells ( <a aria-describedby=\"R36\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#R36\"> <em> 36 </em> </a> ). The contrast with our data with respect to sLeX function on CD44s is notable, and it suggests key differences between hematopoietic and breast CSCs with respect to how glycosylation affects CD44 function. </p> <p> Our work also highlights the confounding nature of CD44 as a breast CSC marker.\n",

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: <p> The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment. </p> <p> The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nature12634) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.\n",

The data set contains 127 diverse SMGs, demonstrating that many cellular and enzymatic processes are involved in tumorigenesis.

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: </p> <p> The three TCGA genome sequencing centres (GSCs; Baylor Human Genome Center, Broad Institute, and The Genome Institute at Washington University) collectively performed exome sequencing on thousands of tumour samples and matched normal tissues, the latter being used as controls to distinguish somatic mutations from inherited variants. These controls were most often peripheral blood, but skin tissue was used in 199 AML samples as well as 1 buccal source, and adjacent tumour-free tissue was used for 927 cases, with 120 cases having normal DNA from blood and adjacent solid normal tissue. </p> <p> Exome capture targets may differ among GSCs, as well as across cohorts at the same GSC because the capture technologies and sequencing platforms continue to evolve over time. Therefore, collecting sequencing coverage data for each sample is crucial for most variant significance analyses.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods | Standardization and tracking of mutation data from 12 cancer types. Content: Somatic variant calling methods also differ among GSCs for similar reasons, in addition to the fact that filtering strategies may be tuned to emphasize either sensitivity or specificity of calls. Finally, the TCGA disease analysis working groups (AWGs) may optionally perform manual curation of the variant calls, in which false positives are removed and true negatives are recovered. AWGs and GSCs also collaboratively select putative variants for validation or for recovering variants from regions that reported low coverage in the first pass of exome sequencing. These steps mean that somatic variant sensitivity and specificity are mostly comparable across samples of a given TCGA tumour type, but that they differ considerably among tumour types, creating significant challenges for Pan-Cancer analyses.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods | Standardization and tracking of mutation data from 12 cancer types. Content: </p> <p> Complete standardization of sensitivity could not be attained, as it would have required a uniform variant calling and filtering workflow across all tumour–normal pairs. Instead, publicly available somatic variant calls in mutation annotation format (MAF) files from the TCGA were used to both ensure reproducibility and take advantage of extensive manual curation performed over the years by experts in the disease or in genomic sequence analysis and annotation. Specifically, all MAF files were downloaded from the TCGA data coordinating centre, each being reprocessed to eliminate known, recurrent false positives and germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in the dbSNP database. All variant coordinates were transferred to GRCh37 and re-annotated using the Gencode human transcript annotation imported from Ensembl release 69.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: Per sample, per gene coverage values were obtained using WIG-formatted reference coverage files associated with the BAMs or by processing the original BAM files directly. Details were tracked on Synapse with provenance and documentation ( <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"https://www.synapse.org/%23!Synapse:syn1729383\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1729383 </a> ). </p> <p> We calculate mutation frequency by dividing the number of validated somatic variants by the number of base pairs that have sufficient coverage. Minimum coverage is six and eight reads for normal and tumour BAMs, respectively. For mutation spectrum we classify the mutation by six types (transitions/transversions). Mutation context is generated by counting the frequency of A, T, C and G nucleotides that are 2 bp 5′ and 3′ to each variant within the six mutation categories.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: For the clustering, we pooled all samples (excluding hypermutators having &gt;500 mutations) for each cancer type. We calculated the mutation context (−2 to +2 bp) for each somatic variant in each mutation category. A hierarchical clustering was then done using the pairwise correlation of the mutation context across all cancer types. We used correlation modules in the mutational significance in cancer (MuSiC) package to identify genes with mutations that are positively correlated with the number of mutations in the tumour sample. This analysis was performed for all 12 cancer types. Only genes mutated in at least 5% of tumours were included in the analysis. A list of genes known to be involved in DNA mismatch repair is included <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 13 </a> .\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: </p> <p> We used the SMG test in the MuSiC suite <sup> <a aria-describedby=\"CR3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#CR3\"> 3 </a> </sup> to identify significant genes for each tumour type and also for Pan-Cancer tumours. This test assigns mutations to seven categories: AT transition, AT transversion, CG transition, CG transversion, CpG transition, CpG transversion and indel, and then uses statistical methods based on convolution, the hypergeometric distribution (Fisher’s test), and likelihood to combine the category-specific binomials to obtain overall <em> P </em> values. All <em> P </em> values were combined using the methods described previously <sup> <a aria-describedby=\"CR3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#CR3\"> 3 </a> </sup> . SMGs are listed in <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig2\"> Fig. 2 </a> .\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: Finally, for the analysis of SMGs, genes not typically expressed in individual tumour type or/and Pan-Cancer tumour samples were filtered if they had an average read per kilobase per million (RPKM) ≤ 0.5. For the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene expression analysis, we used the ‘Pancan12 per-sample log <sub> 2 </sub> -RSEM’ matrix from Synapse ( <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"https://www.synapse.org/%23!Synapse:syn1734155\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1734155 </a> ). A gene qualified as ‘expressed’ if it had at least three reads in at least 70% of samples. Annotation based curation was also performed.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: </p> <p> To make quantitative inferences as to the number of cancer types with which an individual gene associates, we calculated the empirical distributions of frequency for each cancer (tissue) type and declared an association (setting indicator variable to 1) if a given gene frequency within a type exceeded a threshold. Otherwise we set the indicator to 0, indicating no association. We took the threshold as a standardized <em> Z </em> -score of 0.2 above the mean based on the estimated level of noise in the 127 significant genes as quantified by the coefficient of variation for each cancer type. We then computed an overall distribution on the indicator variable. The mean for each functional category having at least five genes was then converted to a <em> Z </em> -score based on the descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the indicator distribution.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: </p> <p> Somatic point mutations and small indels of 127 SMGs across the 3,281 tumours were collected. To reduce noise from passenger mutations, tumours having more than 500 somatic mutations (considered hypermutators) were excluded from this analysis. Tumours with zero detected somatic mutations were also excluded, resulting in mutations from 2,611 tumours for downstream clustering analysis. A mutation status matrix (sample × gene) was constructed and passed to the R function ‘hclust’ for complete-linkage hierarchical clustering and a respective heatmap with a dendrogram was plotted. Tumours from BLCA, HNSC, LUAD and LUSC are largely scattered over the Pan-Cancer cohort, indicating extensive heterogeneity in these diseases. For instance, eight LUAD and two LUSC tumours are in the solid colorectal cluster, largely owing to their <em> KRAS </em> mutations ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig4\"> Fig. 4 </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: Three UCEC, two GBM, one OV and one HSNC samples are in the <em> BRCA </em> cluster courtesy of <em> TP53 </em> and <em> PIK3CA </em> mutations. The resolution of this analysis could be improved by incorporating copy number data, structural variants, gene expression, proteomics and methylation. </p> <p> We used Fisher’s exact test to identify pairs of SMGs with significant (FDR = 0.05 by Benjamini–Hochberg) exclusivity and co-occurrence. We identified significant pairs by analysing all samples together and by analysing samples in each cancer type separately. A large number of pairs (142) with significant co-occurring mutations is identified only considering the Pan-Cancer data set ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig9\"> Extended Data Fig. 4 </a> ); these pairs include several candidate genes (for example, <em> NAV3 </em> , <em> RPL22 </em> and <em> TSHZ3 </em> ) whose function in carcinogenesis is not well characterized.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: </p> <p> We applied our <em> de novo </em> driver exclusivity (Dendrix) algorithm to identify sets of approximately mutually exclusive mutations on all samples together. Dendrix finds a set <em> M </em> of genes of maximum weight <em> W </em> ( <em> M </em> ), in which <em> W </em> ( <em> M </em> ) is the difference between the number of samples with a mutation in <em> M </em> and the number of samples with more than one mutation in <em> M </em> . The maximum scoring set of genes of a given size is identified using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We first applied Dendrix considering only the 127 SMGs, and then extended our analysis to consider the 1,000 genes of smallest median <em> q </em> value among the three <em> q </em> values (convolution, Fisher’s combined test, and likelihood ratio) reported by MuSiC.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: From these 1,000 genes, we discarded the ones with mutations strongly associated (Bonferroni corrected <em> P </em> ≤ 0.05 by Fisher’s exact test) with a cancer type, and this resulted in 600 genes for Dendrix analysis. </p> <p> We also applied Dendrix to identify sets of exclusive mutations among the SMGs in each cancer type separately. The exclusivity and co-occurrence between different sets of mutations was assessed using Fisher’s exact test, and the mutation status (‘mutated’ if at least one gene in the set is mutated, ‘not mutated’ otherwise) of the two sets as categories for the 2 × 2 contingency table. </p> <p> We used the clinical correlation module of MuSiC to examine how clinical features correlate with somatic events within individual tumour types. Fisher’s exact test was used for analysing categorical features, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for quantitative variables.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: We used the standard Cox proportional hazards model for individual cancer types as well as cross-cancer survival analysis, as implemented in the R package ‘survival’ ( <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/ </a> ). Here, the effects of all mutations are taken to be constant over time, that is, they are ‘stationary coefficients’. Hazard ratios exceeding 1 indicate an overall detrimental effect across cancers, whereas those below 1 associate with better outcome. Calculations included only those genes having mutation frequencies of at least 2% (for both individual cancer types and Pan-Cancer) in at least two cancer types (for Pan-Cancer).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: In practice, this means that although some genes encompass many types, for example, <em> TP53 </em> is calculated over 12 types, most are based on only a few ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Tab1\"> Extended Data Table 1 </a> and <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 10a, b </a> ). There is no basis for calculation of genes having 2% mutation in only a single type, although single-type analysis was computed similarly for all genes having at least 2% in all cancer types. Analyses were performed using age and gender as covariates. </p> <p> We also performed Pan-Cancer survival analysis by stratifying on cancer type in the Cox regression model and found the results are largely consistent with taking cancer type as a covariate (14 out of top 15 significant genes are overlapping from these two analyses) ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 10b </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: Furthermore, stage was used as a covariate for individual cancer type survival analysis (AML and COAD/READ not included). Again, the results are fairly consistent with taking only age and gender as covariates (for example, 12 out of top 15 significant genes are overlapping from these two analyses for UCEC) ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 14 </a> ). </p> <p> We computed the VAFs of somatic mutations in SMGs using TCGA targeted validation data or/and exome and RNA sequencing data for AML, BRCA and UCEC. An internally developed tool called Bam2ReadCount (unpublished), which counts the number of reads supporting the reference and variant alleles, was used for computing VAFs for point mutations and short indels in copy number neutral segments. Only mutation sites having ≥20× coverage and SMGs having at least five data points were included in downstream analyses.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: Permutation and <em> t </em> -tests were used to identify genes with significantly higher or lower VAFs than the average ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 11a, b </a> ). These indicate chronological order-of-appearance of somatic events during tumorigenesis. VAFs for mutations from genes that are not identified as significantly mutated were similarly computed for generating control VAF density distribution. We also computed VAF distribution for the other nine cancer types, and plots are included in <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig12\"> Extended Data Fig. 7 </a> . In total, 91 BLCA, 772 BRCA, 144 COAD/READ, 62 GBM, 144 HNSC, 195 KIRC, 197 LAML, 216 LUAD, 146 LUSC, 278 OV and 248 UCEC tumours were used for SMG VAF distribution analysis.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Online Methods. Content: </p> <p> We further investigated the expression level of somatic mutations using available RNA sequencing data for AML, BRCA and UCEC, and then compared observed mutant allele expressions with expected levels based on DNA VAFs (assuming no allelic expression bias). A total of 671 BRCA, 170 AML and 190 UCEC tumours with RNA-seq BAMs were used for this analysis. Notably, we observed at least a twofold increase of variant allele expressions in 3.9%, 12.9% and 5.9% of mutations from SMGs in AML (for example, <em> TP53 </em> , <em> STAG2 </em> and <em> SMC3 </em> ), BRCA (for example, <em> CDH1 </em> , <em> TP53 </em> , <em> GATA3 </em> and <em> MLL3 </em> ), and UCEC (for example, <em> ARID1A </em> and <em> FGFR2 </em> ), respectively ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 11a </a> ). We further compared expression level distributions across mutations from SMGs and non-SMGs.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: For all three cancer types, we clearly observed a shift towards higher expression VAFs in SMGs versus non-SMGs, which was most apparent in BRCA and UCEC ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig13\"> Extended Data Fig. 8a </a> ).

Conversely, <em> KRAS </em> and/or <em> NRAS </em> mutations tend to have lower VAFs in all three tumour types ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig5\"> Fig.\n",

Content: Among 304 and 160 of BRCA and UCEC tumours, respectively, with enough coding mutations for clustering, 35% BRCA and 44% UCEC tumours contained subclones. Our analysis provides the lower bound for tumour heterogeneity, because only coding mutations were used for clustering. In BRCA, 95% (62 out of 65) of cases contained <em> PIK3CA </em> mutations in the founding clone, whereas 33% (3 out of 9) of cases had <em> MLL3 </em> mutations in the subclone.

      "Section Title: Discussion. Content: <p> We have performed systematic analysis of the TCGA Pan-Cancer mutation data set, finding key insights for cancer genomes, as summarized in <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig14\"> Extended Data Fig. 9 </a> . The data set contains 127 diverse SMGs, demonstrating that many cellular and enzymatic processes are involved in tumorigenesis. Notably, 66 of them are also on the ‘mut-driver genes’ list generated by a ratiometric method using COSMIC mutations <sup> <a aria-describedby=\"CR38\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#CR38\"> 38 </a> </sup> . Although a common set of driver mutations exists in each cancer type, the combination of drivers within a cancer type and their distribution within the founding clone and subclones varies for individual patients. This suggests that knowing the clonal architecture of each patient’s tumour will be crucial for optimizing their treatment.\n",
      "Section Title: Discussion. Content: Ultimately, these data and their associations with different clinical features and subtypes should contribute to the formulation of a reference candidate gene panel for all tumour types that could be helpful for prognosis at various clinical time points. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Methods Summary. Content: <p> Mutation data were standardized for 12 cancer types and tracked on Synapse with documentation (10.7303/syn1729383.2). All mutation annotation format files were downloaded from the TCGA data coordinating centre, each being reprocessed to eliminate known, recurrent false positives and germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) present in the dbSNP database. All variant coordinates were converted to GRCh37 and re-annotated using the Gencode human transcript annotation imported from Ensembl release 69. Mutation context (−2 to +2 bp) was calculated for each somatic variant in each mutation category, and hierarchical clustering was then performed using the pairwise mutation context correlation across all cancer types. The mutational significance in cancer (MuSiC) <sup> <a aria-describedby=\"CR3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#CR3\"> 3 </a> </sup> package was used to identify significant genes for both individual tumour types and the Pan-Cancer collective.\n",

      "Section Title: Online Methods | Standardization and tracking of mutation data from 12 cancer types. Content: <p> The three TCGA genome sequencing centres (GSCs; Baylor Human Genome Center, Broad Institute, and The Genome Institute at Washington University) collectively performed exome sequencing on thousands of tumour samples and matched normal tissues, the latter being used as controls to distinguish somatic mutations from inherited variants. These controls were most often peripheral blood, but skin tissue was used in 199 AML samples as well as 1 buccal source, and adjacent tumour-free tissue was used for 927 cases, with 120 cases having normal DNA from blood and adjacent solid normal tissue. </p> <p> Exome capture targets may differ among GSCs, as well as across cohorts at the same GSC because the capture technologies and sequencing platforms continue to evolve over time. Therefore, collecting sequencing coverage data for each sample is crucial for most variant significance analyses.\n",
      "Section Title: Online Methods. Content: For all three cancer types, we clearly observed a shift towards higher expression VAFs in SMGs versus non-SMGs, which was most apparent in BRCA and UCEC ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig13\"> Extended Data Fig. 8a </a> ).

      "Section Title: Standardization and tracking of mutation data from 12 cancer types.

      "Section Title: Mutation frequency and spectrum analysis. Content: <p> We calculate mutation frequency by dividing the number of validated somatic variants by the number of base pairs that have sufficient coverage. Minimum coverage is six and eight reads for normal and tumour BAMs, respectively. For mutation spectrum we classify the mutation by six types (transitions/transversions). Mutation context is generated by counting the frequency of A, T, C and G nucleotides that are 2 bp 5′ and 3′ to each variant within the six mutation categories. For the clustering, we pooled all samples (excluding hypermutators having &gt;500 mutations) for each cancer type. We calculated the mutation context (−2 to +2 bp) for each somatic variant in each mutation category. A hierarchical clustering was then done using the pairwise correlation of the mutation context across all cancer types.\n",
      "Section Title: Mutation frequency and spectrum analysis. Content: We used correlation modules in the mutational significance in cancer (MuSiC) package to identify genes with mutations that are positively correlated with the number of mutations in the tumour sample. This analysis was performed for all 12 cancer types. Only genes mutated in at least 5% of tumours were included in the analysis. A list of genes known to be involved in DNA mismatch repair is included <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 13 </a> . </p>\n",
      "Section Title: SMG analysis. Content: <p> We used the SMG test in the MuSiC suite <sup> <a aria-describedby=\"CR3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#CR3\"> 3 </a> </sup> to identify significant genes for each tumour type and also for Pan-Cancer tumours. This test assigns mutations to seven categories: AT transition, AT transversion, CG transition, CG transversion, CpG transition, CpG transversion and indel, and then uses statistical methods based on convolution, the hypergeometric distribution (Fisher’s test), and likelihood to combine the category-specific binomials to obtain overall <em> P </em> values. All <em> P </em> values were combined using the methods described previously <sup> <a aria-describedby=\"CR3\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#CR3\"> 3 </a> </sup> . SMGs are listed in <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig2\"> Fig. 2 </a> .\n",
      "Section Title: SMG analysis. Content: Finally, for the analysis of SMGs, genes not typically expressed in individual tumour type or/and Pan-Cancer tumour samples were filtered if they had an average read per kilobase per million (RPKM) ≤ 0.5. For the RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)-based gene expression analysis, we used the ‘Pancan12 per-sample log <sub> 2 </sub> -RSEM’ matrix from Synapse ( <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"https://www.synapse.org/%23!Synapse:syn1734155\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1734155 </a> ). A gene qualified as ‘expressed’ if it had at least three reads in at least 70% of samples. Annotation based curation was also performed. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Tumour specificity analysis. Content: <p> To make quantitative inferences as to the number of cancer types with which an individual gene associates, we calculated the empirical distributions of frequency for each cancer (tissue) type and declared an association (setting indicator variable to 1) if a given gene frequency within a type exceeded a threshold. Otherwise we set the indicator to 0, indicating no association. We took the threshold as a standardized <em> Z </em> -score of 0.2 above the mean based on the estimated level of noise in the 127 significant genes as quantified by the coefficient of variation for each cancer type. We then computed an overall distribution on the indicator variable. The mean for each functional category having at least five genes was then converted to a <em> Z </em> -score based on the descriptive statistics (mean and standard deviation) of the indicator distribution. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Unsupervised clustering. Content: <p> Somatic point mutations and small indels of 127 SMGs across the 3,281 tumours were collected. To reduce noise from passenger mutations, tumours having more than 500 somatic mutations (considered hypermutators) were excluded from this analysis. Tumours with zero detected somatic mutations were also excluded, resulting in mutations from 2,611 tumours for downstream clustering analysis. A mutation status matrix (sample × gene) was constructed and passed to the R function ‘hclust’ for complete-linkage hierarchical clustering and a respective heatmap with a dendrogram was plotted. Tumours from BLCA, HNSC, LUAD and LUSC are largely scattered over the Pan-Cancer cohort, indicating extensive heterogeneity in these diseases. For instance, eight LUAD and two LUSC tumours are in the solid colorectal cluster, largely owing to their <em> KRAS </em> mutations ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig4\"> Fig. 4 </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Unsupervised clustering. Content: Three UCEC, two GBM, one OV and one HSNC samples are in the <em> BRCA </em> cluster courtesy of <em> TP53 </em> and <em> PIK3CA </em> mutations. The resolution of this analysis could be improved by incorporating copy number data, structural variants, gene expression, proteomics and methylation. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Dendrix analysis of mutation relationships. Content: <p> We used Fisher’s exact test to identify pairs of SMGs with significant (FDR = 0.05 by Benjamini–Hochberg) exclusivity and co-occurrence. We identified significant pairs by analysing all samples together and by analysing samples in each cancer type separately. A large number of pairs (142) with significant co-occurring mutations is identified only considering the Pan-Cancer data set ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig9\"> Extended Data Fig. 4 </a> ); these pairs include several candidate genes (for example, <em> NAV3 </em> , <em> RPL22 </em> and <em> TSHZ3 </em> ) whose function in carcinogenesis is not well characterized. </p> <p> We applied our <em> de novo </em> driver exclusivity (Dendrix) algorithm to identify sets of approximately mutually exclusive mutations on all samples together.\n",
      "Section Title: Dendrix analysis of mutation relationships. Content: Dendrix finds a set <em> M </em> of genes of maximum weight <em> W </em> ( <em> M </em> ), in which <em> W </em> ( <em> M </em> ) is the difference between the number of samples with a mutation in <em> M </em> and the number of samples with more than one mutation in <em> M </em> . The maximum scoring set of genes of a given size is identified using a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach. We first applied Dendrix considering only the 127 SMGs, and then extended our analysis to consider the 1,000 genes of smallest median <em> q </em> value among the three <em> q </em> values (convolution, Fisher’s combined test, and likelihood ratio) reported by MuSiC. From these 1,000 genes, we discarded the ones with mutations strongly associated (Bonferroni corrected <em> P </em> ≤ 0.05 by Fisher’s exact test) with a cancer type, and this resulted in 600 genes for Dendrix analysis.\n",
      "Section Title: Dendrix analysis of mutation relationships. Content: </p> <p> We also applied Dendrix to identify sets of exclusive mutations among the SMGs in each cancer type separately. The exclusivity and co-occurrence between different sets of mutations was assessed using Fisher’s exact test, and the mutation status (‘mutated’ if at least one gene in the set is mutated, ‘not mutated’ otherwise) of the two sets as categories for the 2 × 2 contingency table. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Cross-cancer-type survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model. Content: <p> We used the clinical correlation module of MuSiC to examine how clinical features correlate with somatic events within individual tumour types. Fisher’s exact test was used for analysing categorical features, and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for quantitative variables. We used the standard Cox proportional hazards model for individual cancer types as well as cross-cancer survival analysis, as implemented in the R package ‘survival’ ( <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/survival/ </a> ). Here, the effects of all mutations are taken to be constant over time, that is, they are ‘stationary coefficients’. Hazard ratios exceeding 1 indicate an overall detrimental effect across cancers, whereas those below 1 associate with better outcome.\n",
      "Section Title: Cross-cancer-type survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model. Content: Calculations included only those genes having mutation frequencies of at least 2% (for both individual cancer types and Pan-Cancer) in at least two cancer types (for Pan-Cancer). In practice, this means that although some genes encompass many types, for example, <em> TP53 </em> is calculated over 12 types, most are based on only a few ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Tab1\"> Extended Data Table 1 </a> and <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 10a, b </a> ). There is no basis for calculation of genes having 2% mutation in only a single type, although single-type analysis was computed similarly for all genes having at least 2% in all cancer types. Analyses were performed using age and gender as covariates.\n",
      "Section Title: Cross-cancer-type survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards model. Content: </p> <p> We also performed Pan-Cancer survival analysis by stratifying on cancer type in the Cox regression model and found the results are largely consistent with taking cancer type as a covariate (14 out of top 15 significant genes are overlapping from these two analyses) ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 10b </a> ). Furthermore, stage was used as a covariate for individual cancer type survival analysis (AML and COAD/READ not included). Again, the results are fairly consistent with taking only age and gender as covariates (for example, 12 out of top 15 significant genes are overlapping from these two analyses for UCEC) ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 14 </a> ). </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Clonality and mutation VAF analysis. Content: <p> We computed the VAFs of somatic mutations in SMGs using TCGA targeted validation data or/and exome and RNA sequencing data for AML, BRCA and UCEC. An internally developed tool called Bam2ReadCount (unpublished), which counts the number of reads supporting the reference and variant alleles, was used for computing VAFs for point mutations and short indels in copy number neutral segments. Only mutation sites having ≥20× coverage and SMGs having at least five data points were included in downstream analyses. Permutation and <em> t </em> -tests were used to identify genes with significantly higher or lower VAFs than the average ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 11a, b </a> ). These indicate chronological order-of-appearance of somatic events during tumorigenesis. VAFs for mutations from genes that are not identified as significantly mutated were similarly computed for generating control VAF density distribution.\n",
      "Section Title: Clonality and mutation VAF analysis. Content: We also computed VAF distribution for the other nine cancer types, and plots are included in <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig12\"> Extended Data Fig. 7 </a> . In total, 91 BLCA, 772 BRCA, 144 COAD/READ, 62 GBM, 144 HNSC, 195 KIRC, 197 LAML, 216 LUAD, 146 LUSC, 278 OV and 248 UCEC tumours were used for SMG VAF distribution analysis. </p> <p> We further investigated the expression level of somatic mutations using available RNA sequencing data for AML, BRCA and UCEC, and then compared observed mutant allele expressions with expected levels based on DNA VAFs (assuming no allelic expression bias).

      "Section Title: Clonality and mutation VAF analysis. Content: Notably, we observed at least a twofold increase of variant allele expressions in 3.9%, 12.9% and 5.9% of mutations from SMGs in AML (for example, <em> TP53 </em> , <em> STAG2 </em> and <em> SMC3 </em> ), BRCA (for example, <em> CDH1 </em> , <em> TP53 </em> , <em> GATA3 </em> and <em> MLL3 </em> ), and UCEC (for example, <em> ARID1A </em> and <em> FGFR2 </em> ), respectively ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#MOESM82\"> Supplementary Table 11a </a> ). We further compared expression level distributions across mutations from SMGs and non-SMGs. For all three cancer types, we clearly observed a shift towards higher expression VAFs in SMGs versus non-SMGs, which was most apparent in BRCA and UCEC ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#Fig13\"> Extended Data Fig. 8a </a> ).

      "Recent advances in systems biology have shown that G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate a multitude of host physiologic responses to microbiota. 1 , 2 Indeed, broad distribution of GPCRs in the gastrointestinal tract and brain likely shape the “gut-brain axis” and other aspects of human pathophysiology. 3 , 4 Of those, over 100 GPCRs are currently considered “orphan GPCRs,” for which the endogenous ligands are not known and the physiological roles are poorly understood. 5 Limitations in the field’s ability to identify metabolite-GPCR regulation have precluded understanding of the pathophysiology and therapeutic development. Interestingly, functional screening has revealed that several gut metabolites are agonists of orphan GPCRs. 1 , 6 – 9 For example, orphan GPR35 is activated by 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in neutrophil recruitment, 10 and orphan GPR84 is agonized by medium-chain fatty acids in inflammation. 11 Furthermore, recent advances in computational sciences and structural biology, such as AlphaFold2, 12 offer unprecedented opportunities to investigate the relationship between structure and function, in particular for orphan GPCRs without known structures.\n",

      "Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by multiple pathophysiological etiologies, including both genetic and environmental factors. 13 – 17 Deposition of amyloid-β (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylation of tau are two hallmarks of AD. 18 Mitophagy, 19 , 20 cellular senescence, 21 and inflammation 22 have been linked to pathophysiology of AD as well. Without the development of effective clinical prevention strategies and disease-modifying treatments that slow the neurodegenerative process in AD, 23 there are predicted to be more than 13.8 million people with AD living in the United States by 2050. 13 The environmental exposome, which is the measure of cumulative exposures of an individual across their lifetime, also plays a crucial role in the etiology and progression of AD. 24 , 25 With our increasing lifespans, the magnitude of the exposome effect is also increasing in society today. Indeed, alterations in the gutmicrobiome and microbe-associated metabolites are increasingly regarded as an important neural exposome linked to the pathophysiology of AD. 26 – 28\n",

      "Growing evidence also shows that patients with AD-related dementia or mild cognitive impairment display microbial dysbiosis characterized by enterotype diversity and abundance. 29 , 30 Recent studies have additionally suggested that alterations in microbiota could contribute to AD-related pathologies in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. 24 , 31 For example, microbiota depletion attenuates inflammation and brain pathology in the amyloid precursor protein and presenilin 1 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mouse model of AD, 32 and aging-associated neurocognitive and immune decline is ameliorated by fecal microbiota transplant from young to aged mice. 33 Advanced metabolomic approaches have also recently identified that both trimethylamine N-oxide, 34 δ-valerobetaine, 35 and N 6 -carboxymethyllysine 36 are elevated in AD. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms linking gut microbial metabolites and their levels to AD remain largely unknown. This is a critical area of investigation because identification of medically relevant gut-brain axis 37 interactions would foster the discovery and development of therapeutic approaches for AD.\n",

      "Here, we present a systems biology framework that integrates machine learning (ML) with network-based genetics approaches and multi-omics to prioritize potential therapeutic targets from the GPCRome and microbiota-derived metabolite-GPCR relationships. We evaluated over 1.09 million metabolite-GPCR pairs using structure-derived computational biophysical approaches (i.e., AlphaFold2) and ML models. This enabled genetics-derived Mendelian randomization (MR) and multi-omics analyses, including human brain-specific transcriptomics and proteomics, which identified potential druggable GPCR targets (including orphan GPCRs) for AD. This framework thus offers a powerful tool to identify potential gut metabolite-based therapies that target human GPCRs for treating AD. In principle, this approach could be readily applied to generate insights into other human complex diseases as well.\n",

      "We created a systems biology framework to identify molecular associations between microbiota-derived metabolites and the GPCRome in AD. This entailed five steps: (1) analyzing AD-associated GPCRs (termed alzGPCRs) from multi-omics (including AD brain transcriptomics and proteomics) ( Figure 1A ; STAR Methods ), (2) identifying likely causal GPCRs and gut microbial metabolites in AD using MR analysis ( Figure 1B ), (3) characterizing gut microbial metabolites from human gut strains, (4) predicting associations between gut microbial metabolites and the GPCRome using structure-derived computational biophysical approaches and an Extra Trees model ( Figure 1C ), and (5) experimentally validating gut microbial metabolites in AD using induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) neurons derived from human AD subjects ( Figure 1D ). The detailed workflow of this process is outlined in Figure S1 . Specifically, we utilized structural models of 408 non-olfactory GPCRs retrieved from AlphaFold2, crystal/cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures, and homology models, including 130 orphan GPCRs ( Figure 1C ). We next developed an Extra Trees model by leveraging three-dimensional (3D) interaction features derived from metabolite-GPCR complexes from molecular docking experiments, followed by reconstruction of the metabolite-GPCR interactome network from the Extra Trees model. Lastly, we experimentally investigated the mechanism of action of top-prioritized candidate gut microbial metabolites in AD by specifically targeting GPCRs. This enabled us to validate a short list of gut microbial metabolite candidates using iPSC-derived neurons from AD subjects.\n",

      "Section Title: RESULTS. Content: RESULTS\n",
      "Through MR analysis of the relationships between 408 GPCRs and AD, 38 – 40 we identified 274 GPCRs with instrument variables (false discovery rate [FDR] < 0.05 and F statistic > 10) from four expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) datasets generated from human cortex samples, 77 of which were orphan GPCRs ( Tables S1 and S2 ). We also identified 6 GPCRs that were significantly associated with AD (FDR < 0.05; Figures 2A and S2 ) in at least one of the 5 MR methods ( STAR Methods ). Five of these GPCRs ( FPR1 [formyl peptide receptor 1], GALR1 [galanin receptor 1], GPR27 , OPN4 [melanopsin], and VIPR2 [vasoactive intestinal peptide receptor 2]) were validated in at least two MR methods (FDR < 0.05; Figure S2 ). We found that up-regulation of both GPR27 and VIPR2 at the transcriptional level indicates an elevated risk of AD ( Figure 2A ). By contrast, elevated expression of TAS2R60 (taste 2 receptor member 60), FPR1 , GALR1 , and OPN4 were associated with reduced risk of AD. For example, bitter receptor TAS2R60 is associated with substantially reduced risk of late onset AD (beta MR = −0.34, FDR = 3.75 × 10 −6 ). Two orphan GPCRs associated with AD from MR analysis are GPR27 and OPN4 . The structural models (from AlphaFold2) of GPR27 and OPN4 showed high structural confidence in the transmembrane domain ( Figure S3 ).\n",

      "We next investigated alzGPCRs through analyzing bulk and single-nucleus transcriptomic or bulk proteomic data from AD brain samples. Using 88 AD transcriptomic and proteomic datasets that we had compiled previously, 41 , 42 we examined differential expression (DE) of 408 GPCRs between pathologic (AD) and control groups ( Table S3 ). We then clustered GPCRs to a circular phylogenetic tree based on protein sequence conservation. The GPCR classes and number of omic layers (i.e., the number of datasets in which GPCRs were differentially expressed) are illustrated in Figure 2B . In total, we found that 93 GPCRs were differentially expressed in at least one AD brain dataset, 23 of which were orphan GPCRs. We then prioritized alzGPCRs based on the degree of DE and identified 10 GPCRs with DE in at least 5 AD omics datasets ( Figure 2B ), including ADRA2A (A drenoceptor alpha 2A ), C3AR ( Complement C3a Receptor ), CX3CR1 ( C-X3-C motif chemokine receptor 1 ), CXCR4 ( C-X-C chemokine receptor type 4 ), GPR34 , GPR84 , GPR183 , GPC5B , HCAR2 ( Hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2 ), and Pyrimidinergic Receptor P2RY6 . Of these, GPR34 , GPR84 , GPR183 , and GPC5B are orphan GPCRs. Among all differentially expressed GPCRs, GPR84 was identified as the strongest candidate, followed by CX3CR1 , CXCR4 , and GPR34 (representative AlphaFold2 structures are shown in Figure 2B ). GPR84 also had the strongest DE between AD and controls (DE in 15 brain transcriptomic or proteomic datasets). Of note, microglial GPR84 43 has been previously identified as a target of medium-chain fatty acids that mediate neuroinflammation 11 and promote microgliosis in APP/PS1 mice, 44 and CX3CR1 and CXCR4 mediate neuroinflammation and regulate microglial activation. 45 , 46 GPR34 (DE in 9 brain transcriptomic datasets), another orphan GPCR specifically over-expressed in microglia, 47 was also identified as a potential risk gene for AD. 48 , 49\n",

In total, 24 gut metabolites with high abundance in gut microbiota genera 50 were associated with AD ( p < 0.05) ( Figure S4A ; STAR Methods ). In addition, some have been previously reported to be associated with AD, such as Akkermansia , Bacteroides , Bifidobacterium , and Ruminococcus . 51 – 53 The toxin 2-hydroxy-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid (HMB) has elevated abundance in Bifidobacterium (log 2 fold change [log 2 FC] = 8.83, relative FC over the germ-free control). 50 In particular, 3 out of 24 human gut microbial metabolites (HMB, phosphoethanolamine, and glutamine) were significantly associated with increased/decreased risk of AD in at least two MR methods ( Figure S4B ). Phosphoethanolamine produced by bacterium Akkermansia muciniphila was significantly associated with an elevated risk of AD (beta MR = 0.68, FDR = 3.36 × 10 −6 ). Akkermansia muciniphila has been shown to alleviate impairment in an AD mouse model. 51 Thus, our findings offer a likely causal relationship between the gut microbial metabolites and AD.\n",

For GPCR structural models, we retrieved (1) 3D structures predicted by AlphaFold2 ( n = 416 models for 408 non-olfactory GPCRs [hereafter termed AlphaFold2-predicted models]; Table S7 ); (2) experimentally determined crystal/cryo-EM structures deposited in Protein Data Bank (PDB) 54 ( n = 482 models for 92 GPCRs [termed PDB models]); and (3) homology models from GPCRdb 55 ( n = 1,031 models for 404 GPCRs). Of these, 77 GPCRs were common among all three resources. We observed that AlphaFold2-predicted structures contained high-confidence transmembrane helix (TM) regions (predicted local distance difference test score > 70; Figure S5A ) 12 and small TM root-mean-square deviation compared to experimentally determined PDB structures (<1 Å; Figure S5B ). This indicates the high quality of AlphaFold2-predicted GPCR models. In total, we evaluated 1,090,760 metabolite-GPCR pairs connecting 408 GPCRs (a total of 3,256 ligand-binding druggable pockets 56 ) and 335 human gut microbial metabolites. We found a high Pearson’s correlation coefficient (R) of docking scores on 77 common GPCRs shared between AlphaFold2-predicted models and PDB structures (R = 0.85, p < 2.2 × 10 −16 ) ( Figure S6 ).\n",

A total of 32 alzGPCRs were determined, including 37.5% orphan GPCRs (12/32), such as GPR84 ( Figure 5A ). We found that the AD risk-associated metabolite phosphoethanolamine ( Figure S4B ) was predicted to bind with a phospholipid receptor, PTAFR (platelet activating factor receptor, Figure 5A ).

GALR1 and FPR1 , two peptide alzGPCRs supported by both genetic and transcriptomic/proteomic evidence ( Figure 2 ), are mainly expressed in the brain and gastrointestinal tract. FPR1 has been implicated in the regulation of mucosal immune systems, and over-expression of GALR1 has been associated with cognitive decline in AD. 59 , 60 GALR1 and FPR1 interact with linolenic acid and 5-phenylvaleric acid, respectively ( Figure 4C ). TAS2R60 , a GPCR with the strongest AD genome-wide association study (GWAS) evidence, has strong GPCR-ML scores with butylated hydroxytoluene and 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid, and elevated 2,4-dihydroxybutanoic acid has been associated with early-stage AD. 61 Another AD GWAS-supported orphan GPCR, GPR27 , is highly expressed in human brain and is involved in neuronal plasticity and cognition 62 – 64 and has been shown to be elevated with cognitive decline. 65 GPR84 was identified as an alzGPCR harboring the strongest multi-omics evidence ( Figure 2B ), showing the highest number of pairs with top-ranked candidate metabolites (9/31, 29%; Figure 4B ). We illustrated two GPR84 potential binding pockets, one of which is an allosteric site ( Figure S18A ). The gut cinnamaldehyde was identified to bind to this allosteric pocket by forming a hydrogen bond with Asp339 ( Figure S18B ). Our Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM/PBSA) calculation predicted that the cinnamaldehyde has a comparable binding affinity to the well-known GPR84 antagonist (tridecanoic acid with a Ki of 1.93 μM, 66 ΔΔG difference: ~1.5 kcal/mol; Figure S18C ), suggesting a potential physical interaction between cinnamaldehyde and GPR84 ( STAR Methods ).\n",

A total of 32 alzGPCRs were determined, including 37.5% orphan GPCRs (12/32), such as GPR84 ( Figure 5A ). We found that the AD risk-associated metabolite phosphoethanolamine ( Figure S4B ) was predicted to bind with a phospholipid receptor, PTAFR (platelet activating factor receptor, Figure 5A ). Phosphoethanolamine forms electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds with Asp254, Lys320, Thr325, and Phe319 in PTAFR ( Figure 5B ).

With additional focus on GPR84 through prioritizing its top 50 gut metabolites by GPCR-ML score ( Figure 5C ), we observed lipid-like metabolites (16/50) and fatty acids or its derivatives, including 5 medium-chain fatty acids. To functionally validate the predicted gut metabolites associated with GPR84, the gut metabolite triacanthine was tested via a cAMP assay 81 ( STAR Methods ) in HEK293 cells to evaluate the alterations in downstream G protein α subtype G i / o signaling of GPR84.

We found that orphan GPR153 ranked as the top candidate target of phenethylamine based on the GPCR-ML score ( Table S11 ).

VIPR2 and OPN4 were predicted to potentially bind with fatty acids (stearic acid and oleic acid, respectively). CX3CR1 and CXCR4 are chemokine receptors that were prioritized here by transcriptomic or proteomic analysis, and their activation has been implicated in protection from tau pathology. 95 The top-ranked candidate metabolite for CX3CR1 is 8-hydroxyquinoline and for CXCR4 are N-butyrylglycine and rac-glycerol 1-myristate (a fatty acid derivative). GPR183, an immunomodulatory EBI2 receptor, was recently reported to be antagonized by a gut metabolite lauroyl tryptamine derived from E. rectale . 96 HCAR2 (GPR109A), a microglial receptor playing a protective role in AD, 97 was activated by nicotinic acid derived from R. guavus . 6 Here, we identified the top-ranked candidate metabolites for GPR183 as phenylthanolamine and tryptophan ethyl ester.

In addition, we also experimentally observed that phenethylamine reduced the p-tau levels in AD patient iPSC-derived neurons. Phenethylamine, a trace amine, has been associated with reduced risk of AD. 104 We predicted that phenethylamine interacted with GPR153, an understudied GPCR widely expressed in human brains. GPR153 knockdown rats exhibited significant reduction in the percentage of time spent in the center square. 105 Using brain transcriptomic data, we found that GPR153 is highly differentially expressed in 4 AD mouse brain transcriptomic datasets ( Figure 2B ; Table S18 ). However, due to very few functional studies on GPR153, the molecular mechanisms of how phenethylamine decreased the tau level via GPR153 are warranted to be further determined.

The mean of normalized scores for each metabolite across all GPCRs were then calculated ( Figure S13 ). The metabolite-GPCRome interaction network was subsequently classified into three groups based on hierarchical clusters of metabolites ( Figure S13A ): lipid and lipid-like, organic acid, and organoheterocyclic. The average score for the lipid and lipid-like group was ~1.3-fold higher than the organic acid group and ~2.6-fold higher than organoheterocyclic group ( p < 2.22 × 10 −16 , Mann-Whitney U test, Figure S13B ).\n",

The metabolite profiles and abundance derived from E. rectale were re-analyzed ( Figure S21 ). 3 gut metabolites (including indolelactate, 4-hydroxyhydratropate and dimesol) were elevated by at least 4-fold (log2FC ≥ 2) ( Figure 6A ). Top 10 GPCRs of 3 metabolites prioritized 5 alzGPCRs predicted by our MR and multi-omics analyses, including APJ (apelin receptor), ADRA1D (adrenoceptor Alpha 1D), ADRB1 (adrenoceptor beta 1), PKR1 (prokineticin receptor 1) and LPAR6 (lysophosphatidic acid receptor 6) ( Figure 6B ). Two of their genes (ADRB1 and LPAR6) were also differentially expressed in DAM (FDR <0.05, vs. HAM) based on single nucleus RNA-seq data analysis. In addition, three alzGPCRs (APJ, ADRA1D and LPAR6) were predicted to be the targets of 4-hydroxyhydratropate. APJ receptor is shared by all 3 metabolites and predicted as the top-one ranked target ( Figure 6B ).\n",

      "To define the pocket location, the generic residue number was adopted based on GPCRdb numbering scheme. 55 For class A, the orthosteric site was defined as being in extracellular sites between the transmembrane helix segments. Based on previous report, 147 high frequency residues are adopted as our reference residues: 2×60, 2×63, 3×28, 3×29, 3×32, 3×33, 3×36, 3×37, 45×52, 5×40, 5×41, 5×44, 5×45, 5×47, 6×44, 6×48, 6×51, 6×52, 6×55, 6×58, 7×30, 7×33, 7×37, 7×40, 7×41. Each pocket containing a minimum of five residues among the reference residues was categorized as the orthosteric pocket. Initially, the generic numbers of reference residues were matched with the sequence numbers of every protein model. This process was then implemented for each pocket in every model, resulting in a compilation of pocket types. Subsequently, we compared every docking pocket of GPCR-metabolite pairs with the pocket set, thereby enabling us to examine the distribution of orthosteric pockets in docking results. Any pocket that varied from the identified orthosteric pocket was considered an allosteric pocket. The same analysis was employed to classify T receptors. 148\n",

      "In total, 625 pockets for AlphaFold2-predicted models, 767 pockets for crystal structure models and 1,867 pockets for homology models from GPCRdb were analyzed and applied to define pocket types on all GPCR-metabolites docking pairs. For 77 common GPCRs, the occupancy of orthosteric sites in PDB structures, AlphaFold2-predicted and homology models are 60.7%, 55.6% and 56.9%, respectively ( Figure S15A ). The distinct patterns of pocket distributions across three structural models were displayed in Figure S16 . For the entire GPCR dataset, the occupancy of allosteric sites in AlphaFold2-predicted models, PDB structures and homology models are 58.4, 41.8% and 45.6%, respectively ( Figure S15B ). To avoid the bias introduced by different number of GPCRs contained within structural models, we compared the pocket profiles of 99 common orphan GPCRs shared by AlphaFold2-predicted models and homology models. 61.4% of the pockets from AlphaFold2-predicted models and 47.1% of the pockets from homology models are allosteric sites ( Figure S15C ). Specifically, 2,010 metabolite-class C GPCR pairs were investigated and classified into 9 pocket types (Pocket A-H, Figure S17 ). Since the orthosteric site of Class C receptors is in the extracellular domain, all 9 identified pockets are indicated as allosteric sites and 4 sites are in the lipid-receptor interface ( Figure S17 ).\n",

      "Synaptic plasticity is the basis of acquiring and storing new information in the brain 2 and can be induced by specific patterns of electrical activity 3 . In the classical Hebbian mechanism, coordinated presynaptic and postsynaptic activation leads to removal of the Mg 2+ block in NMDARs. This process allows Ca 2+ ions to flow into dendritic spines to activate enzymes, including CaMKII, to induce synaptic potentiation 4 . However, computational studies suggest that the Hebbian plasticity rule, which requires temporal coincidence within milliseconds, does not fit with simple learning behaviours that occur over seconds to minutes 5 .\n",

      "Recently, BTSP was discovered at CA3–CA1 synapses as a mechanism of place cell formation 1 , 6 . In this type of plasticity, brief postsynaptic depolarization is paired with presynaptic inputs within a behavioural time scale or within hundreds of milliseconds to seconds to induce synaptic potentiation during place cell induction. Synaptic potentiation can be induced either by forward (presynaptic stimulation followed by postsynaptic depolarization) or converse pairing (depolarization followed by presynaptic stimulation). BTSP can be interpreted as a product of eligibility trace, an input-specific signal lasting for a few seconds, and instructive signals by postsynaptic depolarization, which induces synaptic potentiation in eligible synapses. For converse BTSP (cBTSP), the instructive signal must also influence the synapse-specific signal over a few seconds. Studies suggest that BTSP requires a plateau potential and Ca 2+ spikes in dendrites, perhaps providing instructive signals 1 , 7 . However, the molecular representations of the eligibility trace and the instructive signal are unknown.\n",

      "Using two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging (2pFLIM) of a fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensor, previous studies have shown that CaMKII is activated in a synapse-specific manner during glutamate uncaging-induced structural plasticity of dendritic spines 8 , 9 . CaMKII remains active for 1–6 s after glutamate uncaging owing to autophosphorylation at the T286 site 9 , 10 . This time scale of CaMKII activation (seconds) makes it a potential entity for the eligibility trace. However, a previous study suggests that CaMKII is required for BTSP expression but not induction 11 .\n",

      "In this study, we investigated the role of CaMKII in BTSP using an improved CaMKII conformational sensor in hippocampal slices. First, we developed a protocol to induce BTSP at individual dendritic spines using glutamate uncaging. Second, we improved the sensitivity of a CaMKII sensor by about twofold. Using this new sensor, instead of synapse-specific CaMKII activity, we observed DDSC tens of seconds after the induction of BTSP. We confirmed the requirement of DDSC for BTSP by optogenetically inhibiting CaMKII 12 . Finally, we showed that DDSC and BTSP require IP 3 -dependent Ca 2+ release from internal stores. Our experiments demonstrate a crucial role of non-synapse-specific CaMKII activation as an instructive signal that spans an extended time scale (tens of seconds) in BTSP.\n",

      "To investigate whether BTSP can be induced in single spines, we used whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology on CA1 neurons in organotypic hippocampal slices. We measured two-photon uncaging-evoked excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) from one to two spines on secondary branches of proximal apical dendrites before and after the induction of BTSP (Fig. 1a , orange). To induce BTSP, we delivered a train of 5 uncaging pulses on 1 spine at 1 Hz intervals, and then after a 750 ms delay from the last pulse, we gave a current injection (600 pA, 300 ms) (Fig. 1b ). This protocol induced a 90 ± 14% ( n = 26) potentiation in EPSP amplitude in the stimulated spines (Fig. 1d,e ), but not in adjacent spines (1 ± 9%, n = 17; Fig. 1d,e ). In the cBTSP protocol (Fig. 1a , purple), we applied a current injection (600 pA, 300 ms) that was delivered 750 ms before the first pulse of 5 uncaging pulses at 1 Hz (Fig. 1c ). This protocol also induced a similar potentiation (81 ± 25%, n = 15) in EPSP amplitude in stimulated spines but not in adjacent spines (13 ± 10%, n = 14) (Fig. 1f,g ). Similarly, in acute hippocampal slices (from mice aged postnatal day 25 (P25)–P35), the BTSP protocol induced potentiation (103 ± 29%, n = 12) in stimulated spines but not in adjacent spines (18 ± 7%, n = 8) (Fig. 1h–j ). These results demonstrate that BTSP can be induced in single dendritic spines in a synapse-specific manner both in acute and organotypic slices.

      "Because basal and distal dendrites receive different inputs as compared to proximal apical dendrites 13 , we investigated whether BTSP can also be induced in these dendrites. Notably, the same BTSP protocol failed to induce EPSP potentiation at basal or distal apical dendrites (>200 μm from the soma) (basal, 7 ± 17%, n = 10; distal, 12 ± 12%, n = 8) (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b ). Thus, the BTSP induction mechanism may depend on the location of dendritic branches. Next, we examined the molecular mechanism of BTSP using pharmacological inhibitors and transgenic mice. The voltage-gated sodium channel inhibitor tetrodotoxin (TTX; 1 μM) and the NMDAR inhibitor APV (50 μM) inhibited BTSP induction in stimulated spines (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 1c,d ). BTSP was also inhibited by QX314 (1–3 mM), a membrane-impermeable sodium channel blocker, included in the patch pipette (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 1e ). As the BTSP protocol should not effectively release Mg 2+ block from NMDARs, we further investigated a potential role for non-ionotropic NMDAR signalling using MK-801, a channel pore blocker for NMDAR 14 , 15 . MK-801 also blocked BTSP, which suggested that canonical ionotropic NMDAR signalling is required for BTSP (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 1f ). Furthermore, similar to a previous study 11 , mutant mice in which the Ca 2+ -independent autonomous activity of CaMKIIα generated by T286 autophosphorylation is prevented ( Camk2a T286A ) showed no BTSP (Fig. 1k,l and Extended Data Fig. 1g ). These results suggest that similar to Hebbian long-term potentiation (LTP), postsynaptic spiking, activation of NMDAR and generation of autonomous CaMKII activity are required for BTSP induction.\n",

      "If CaMKII represents the eligibility trace, its activation should be localized in the stimulated spines and last for a few seconds. This synaptic input will not release the Mg 2+ block; thus, Ca 2+ signalling is likely to be small. To detect anticipated small levels of CaMKII activity during BTSP, we optimized our CaMKII sensor by putting two accepters in the original Green Camuiα sensor 8 , which produced 2dV-Camui (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Information ). 2dV-Camui displayed a twofold higher signal with a similar time course compared with the unmodified version when tested in cell lines (Fig. 2b–d and Extended Data Fig. 2 ) and in uncaging-evoked CaMKII activation in dendritic spines. Note that structural LTP experiments in Fig. 2 are under zero extracellular Mg 2+ conditions. All other experiments were performed using 1 mM Mg 2+ (ref. 8 ) (Fig. 2e–g ). As expected, we observed a rapid decay in CaMKII activation for a sensor in which the crucial autophosphorylation site (T286) is mutated 10 (Fig. 2h,i ). Also, mutations that turn off calmodulin binding (T305 and T306) eliminated its activation (Fig. 2h and Extended Data Fig. 3 ). Moreover, we confirmed that this sensor forms the usual multimeric holoenzyme based on fluctuation correlation spectroscopy and fluorescence-coupled size-exclusion chromatography (Extended Data Figs. 4 and 5 ).

      "To investigate CaMKII activity during BTSP, we performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology on 2dV-Camui-expressing CA1 neurons in organotypic slices and imaged CaMKII activity during BTSP induction (Fig. 3a ). Although there was no detectable CaMKII activity during BTSP induction (Fig. 3b–d ), we observed CaMKII activation both in stimulated and adjacent dendrites with a delay of tens of seconds (Fig. 3b,c ). This delayed global CaMKII activity showed stochasticity in its timing. Overall, 79% of dendrites showed delayed CaMKII activation, with peak timings ranging from 0 to 100 s and particularly clustered around 30–40 s ( n = 82 dendrites; Fig. 3c–e ). This CaMKII activity was abolished by TTX, which suggested that postsynaptic firing or ongoing circuit activity is involved in this process ( n = 9; Extended Data Fig. 6 ). In control neurons without any stimulation, we also observed CaMKII activation but with a significantly lower frequency (no stimulation, n = 35; Fig. 3c–e ). Similarly, uncaging pulses without current injection (uncaging, n = 26; Extended Data Fig. 7a ) and current injection without uncaging (depolarization, n = 22; Extended Data Fig. 7b ) showed CaMKII activation with a frequency substantially lower than in BTSP-induced dendrites. Similar delayed CaMKII activity was observed when the cBTSP protocol was used, but the timing of CaMKII activation was more delayed ( n = 37, 70–100 s; Fig. 3c–e and Extended Data Fig. 8a–e ). In a subset of experiments for which we recorded CaMKII activation before BTSP induction for a longer time (100 s) and after BTSP, we also observed a significant increase in CaMKII activation after BTSP induction (Extended Data Fig. 7c,d ). The average time course (Fig. 3f ) showed a downwards drift in the measurement, perhaps due to photobleaching. However, on top of the drift, there was a substantial increase in CaMKII activity in BTSP-induced and in cBTSP-induced dendrites about 30–40 s after the protocol, but not in the control groups (uncaging, depolarization and no stimulus). The area under the curve in BTSP and cBTSP dendrites from 30 to 40 s showed significantly higher CaMKII activation than with the three controls (Fig. 3g ). We found no difference in the peak amplitude of CaMKII activity between BTSP-induced and cBTSP-induced samples compared with the three controls (Extended Data Fig. 7e ), which indicated that BTSP increases the frequency, but not the amplitude, of CaMKII activation. Similar CaMKII activation was also observed in basal dendrites, although BTSP was not induced in these dendrites (Extended Data Fig. 9 ).

      "In a subset of the above experiments, we recorded EPSPs in stimulated spines and found similar BTSP potentiation in the CaMKII-labelled neurons (Extended Data Fig. 10a,b ). Moreover, there was an inverse correlation between the magnitude of potentiation and the time of CaMKII occurrence after BTSP induction (Extended Data Fig. 10c ), which suggested that earlier CaMKII activity tends to result in a higher magnitude of potentiation. This correlation was not observed for cBTSP (Extended Data Fig. 8e ). These experiments suggest that both the BTSP and the cBTSP protocols induce DDSC. Moreover, DDSC required both presynaptic and postsynaptic components, which indicated that CaMKII upstream signalling can integrate these components.\n",

DDSC was more predominant in the BTSP-induced dendrites than in the soma or primary dendrites (Fig. 3i–k ). Moreover, 50% of the recordings showed CaMKII activity specific to the BTSP-stimulated dendrites, whereas 36% of them showed CaMKII activity both in the BTSP-stimulated dendrites and in the soma (or primary dendrite) (Fig. 3j ). Furthermore, the peak CaMKII amplitude in dendrites was significantly higher in the BTSP-induced dendrites than in the soma or primary dendrites (Fig. 3k ). A similar spatial profile of DDSC was observed following the cBTSP protocol ( n = 14; Extended Data Fig. 8f–h ). Overall, these experiments suggest that DDSC has a limited spread to primary dendrites and the soma.\n",

      "Because CaMKII activation requires an increase in Ca 2+ levels 16 , we proposed that DDSC is associated with dendritic Ca 2+ increases. To test this hypothesis, we performed Ca 2+ imaging by filling the cell with Cal-590 (50–100 μM) dye in a whole-cell configuration for 4 min before and after the BTSP protocol (Fig. 4a–c ). We confirmed that applying the BTSP protocol potentiated EPSPs in stimulated spines in dye-filled neurons (Extended Data Fig. 11a–c ). Consistent with DDSC, most Ca 2+ events occurred in close correlation with plateau potentials during 4-min recordings after the BTSP protocol (Fig. 4b and Extended Data Fig. 11d ). The frequency of these delayed Ca 2+ events peaked around 20–30 s, consistent with DDSC (Extended Data Fig. 12 ). Like DDSC, Ca 2+ increases also occurred before stimulation, but were significantly less frequent (Fig. 4c ).

      "To examine whether these delayed Ca 2+ transients and the plateau potential correspond to CaMKII activity, we performed simultaneous Ca 2+ and CaMKII imaging by filling 2dV-Camui-transfected CA1 neurons with a Ca 2+ indicator, Cal-590 (50 μM), through a patch pipette (Fig. 4d ). The increases in Ca 2+ during the BTSP protocol, which were probably due to back-propagating action potentials, were substantially smaller in amplitude and did not show associated CaMKII events (Fig. 4e ). However, after BTSP, we observed CaMKII activity corresponding to DDSC associated with Ca 2+ increases and the plateau potential (Fig. 4d ). The Ca 2+ -triggered average of CaMKII activity clearly showed that the onset of CaMKII activation was temporally aligned with Ca 2+ increases (Fig. 4e,f ). Both Ca 2+ and CaMKII events were larger during delayed events than those during the BTSP protocol (Fig. 4g,h ).\n",

However, depolarization alone did not induce such increases (Extended Data Fig. 13c ). Similarly, we performed calcium imaging experiments with our single synapse uncaging BTSP protocol and found similar delayed calcium events following BTSP induction (Extended Data Fig. 13e–g ).

      "To test whether DDSC is essential in BTSP induction, we transduced neurons with the photoinducible competitive CaMKII inhibitor paAIP2 (ref. 12 ) using AAV, and inhibited CaMKII 0, 15 or 30 s after BTSP induction by illuminating with blue light (470 nm) (Fig. 5a,b and Extended Data Fig. 14a ). Control CA1 neurons, which express paAIP2 but were not exposed to blue light, showed potentiation in EPSPs after the BTSP protocol (89 ± 20%, n = 17; Fig. 5c,d ). However, when we inhibited CaMKII 0, 15 or 30 s after the BTSP protocol by blue light, significantly less synaptic potentiation was induced (11 ± 14% for blue light with 0 s delay, n = 10; −1.5 ± 8% for 15 s delay, n = 10; 14 ± 8% for 30 s delay, n = 11) (Fig. 5c,e–g and Extended Data Fig. 14b ).

      "We next examined whether DDSC is sufficient as an instructive signal in BTSP. We applied the BTSP protocol and inhibited plateau potentials through bath application of TTX (1 µM) in the voltage clamp and then artificially induced delayed Ca 2+ –CaMKII signalling through a long, delayed depolarization pulse (10–12 s delay, 20 s width) 8 (Fig. 5h ). In control neurons, a protocol similar to BTSP, a train of 5 uncaging pulses at 1 Hz paired with depolarization to 0 mV after a 750 ms delay, failed to induce synaptic potentiation (7 ± 8%, n = 10; Fig. 5i–k ). However, in separate experiments, when the long depolarization pulse was delivered 10–12 s after the BTSP protocol, we observed a potentiation of EPSC amplitude in the stimulated spines (56.3 ± 16%, n = 19; Fig. 5i–k and Extended Data Fig. 14c ), which suggested that depolarization-induced CaMKII 8 provides instructive signals. When only uncaging pulses (without the depolarization during BTSP) were paired with a long-delayed depolarization pulse, we observed no significant change in EPSC amplitude in the stimulated spines (15.7 ± 11.4%, n = 14), which suggested that initial depolarization during BTSP also contributes to BTSP induction (Fig. 5h–k and Extended Data Fig. 14c ). Taken together with results from the optogenetic experiments, these data indicate that delayed depolarization activates dendritic CaMKII, which provides an instructive signal essential for inducing synapse-specific BTSP.\n",

      "A previous study showed that intracellular Ca 2+ release from internal stores is required for in vivo BTSP-induced place cell formation 17 . Furthermore, intracellular store-induced Ca 2+ release can be induced through IP 3 -dependent mechanisms 18 . L-type calcium channels (LTCCs), which are required for BTSP 1 , also play a pivotal part in Ca 2+ release from internal stores in dendrites 19 . Thus, we investigated the role of LTCCs and intracellular Ca 2+ release in BTSP and DDSC using various inhibitors. The following compounds were used: thapsigargin (1 μM), which depletes internal stores; xestospongin C (XestC, 1 μM), which inhibits the IP 3 receptor (IP 3 R); U73122 (10 μM), which inhibits phospholipase C (the synthesis pathway of IP 3 from PIP2); and nifedipine (10 μM), a blocker of LTCC. All these compounds significantly inhibited BTSP-induced synaptic potentiation compared to vehicle (DMSO) (Fig. 6a–d ). Moreover, CaMKII imaging showed that DDSC was impaired in the presence of these drugs (Fig. 6e–g ). Thus, LTCCs and IP 3 -dependent intracellular Ca 2+ release is required for BTSP and DDSC.

      "BTSP has been a leading model for the induction of CA1 place cells. Our uncaging-evoked BTSP induced potentiation only in stimulated spines but not surrounding spines, which demonstrated that like Hebbian plasticity 21 , 22 , BTSP is an input-specific potentiation mechanism. This result supports previous studies suggesting that input-specific dendritic plasticity underlies place cell formation at a specific location 23 – 25 . Although the synapse-specific role of CaMKII in synaptic potentiation has been speculated, we did not observe any detectable spine-specific CaMKII activation during the BTSP protocol, even with our improved CaMKII sensor. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of some CaMKII activation below our detection limit during BTSP. In particular, a small fraction of CaMKII bound to GluN2B may provide synapse specificity 26 , 27 . Instead, we observed a global, delayed and stochastic CaMKII activity that spreads throughout the dendrite and nearby spines (DDSC). Our photoinhibition and voltage-clamp experiments indicated that DDSC has an essential role in BTSP induction. Ca 2+ influx from LTCCs seems to lead to additional amplification by Ca 2+ -induced Ca 2+ release, which produced sufficiently high Ca 2+ increases for DDSC and BTSP. As DDSC, but not BTSP, is induced in basal dendrites, DDSC may not be linked with BTSP or additional inhibitory signalling may exist downstream of DDSC in basal dendrites. This may be related to a previous report suggesting that basal and apical dendrites have different properties of ER–mitochondrial coupling, which is essential for BTSP during place cell formation 17 . As the IP 3 pathway can be regulated by Gq protein-coupled receptors, DDSC may receive additional regulation by neuromodulators.\n",

      "It is mechanistically intriguing how presynaptic and postsynaptic activities are integrated over several hundreds of milliseconds and still result in NMDAR-dependent and synapse-specific plasticity. Although the time constant of CaMKII activation during Hebbian plasticity matches with the eligibility trace of BTSP, our study indicated that CaMKII is not the eligibility trace because CaMKII activation during BTSP was neither specific to the stimulated synapse nor active during the behavioural time scale (about 1 s). However, the global and delayed nature of DDSC would be consistent with its role as an instructive signal, although it provides a time window much larger than the proposed instructive signal 28 . As DDSC requires both presynaptic and postsynaptic components, additional biochemical signalling must exist upstream of CaMKII signalling (Fig. 6a ). Furthermore, as BTSP-induced synaptic potentiation is spine-specific, the protocol needs to activate synapse-specific signalling to prime the stimulated spine, potentially through NMDAR-dependent signalling 14 , 29 . Overall, there are at least two time scales in this model: one for integrating presynaptic and postsynaptic inputs over the behavioural time scale (around 1 s), and the other for associating the synapse-specific priming signal and the instructive DDSC (10–100 s) (Fig. 6a ). The integration of signals during the behavioural time scale does not need to encode synapse specificity, as this integration can occur in the dendrite and lead to delayed plateau potentials and DDSC (Fig. 6a ). Instead, signal association during the slow time scale seems to give rise to the synapse specificity of BTSP. In vivo recording suggests that place cells are formed rapidly after spontaneous or experimentally induced plateau potentials 1 , 6 . However, it is unclear how the synapses are potentiated when generating this plateau potential during place cell formation. Our results indicated that upstream intracellular signalling may have started tens of seconds ahead of time to prime the stimulated synapses and to facilitate the generation of plateau potentials, which in turn contribute to synaptic potentiation during place cell formation.\n",

In a subset of experiments, uncaging-evoked EPSPs were measured before and after BTSP induction. For simultaneous Ca 2+ and CaMKII imaging experiments, Ca 2+ was normalized to the average of the first 100 frames before the induction of BTSP.

      "Ca 2+ imaging was performed by loading calcium dyes Cal-590 (50–100 μM, AAT Bioquest) together with a structural marker Alexa-488 (100 μM, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Ca 2+ sensor intensity measurements were collected at 64 × 64 pixels at the frame rate of 7.8 Hz with 2pFLIM (lifetime information was not used). The Ca 2+ response was calculated by normalizing the intensity with the intensity of Alexa-488. The membrane voltage was also recorded during Ca 2+ imaging under the current-clamp mode. In a subset of experiments, uncaging-evoked EPSPs were measured before and after BTSP induction. For simultaneous Ca 2+ and CaMKII imaging experiments, Ca 2+ was normalized to the average of the first 100 frames before the induction of BTSP. For Ca 2+ imaging experiments in acute hippocampal slices, we performed a whole-cell patch clamp with electrodes (4–6 MΩ) loaded with Cs + -based internal solution (see above) plus Cal-590 (50 µM). We measured the baseline Ca 2+ for 2–4 min and then applied a published BTSP protocol 1 , whereby Schaffer collaterals were stimulated with bipolar electrodes 10 times at 20 Hz and paired with postsynaptic current injection (300 pA for 300 ms) with a delay of 750 ms for 5 times. Then, Ca 2+ imaging was resumed for another 2–4 mins. The Ca 2+ events were detected using a custom Python code, whereby 3 times the standard deviation of the baseline noise was used as a detection threshold after the subtraction of the basal trend line obtained by linear regression.\n",

      "Extended Data Fig. 5 Chromatography assay of CaMKII sensors. To estimate the approximate oligomeric state of CaMKII sensors, we performed FSEC on EGFP-CaMKIIα and various Camui proteins expressed in HEK293 cells by transient transfection. The cell lysates expressing these proteins were directly injected to a Superose-6 column, and EGFP fluorescence was detected using 475/507 nm excitation/emission wavelengths. Green Camuiα (1dV-Camui), Green Camuiβ (in which CaMKIIβ subunit is used instead of CaMKIIα), and 2dV-Camui are compared with EGFP-CaMKIIα. 2dV-Camui showed a similar retention time to EGFP-CaMKIIα and 1dV-Camui (peak at ~27 min; arrow 1), suggesting the formation of a dodecamer. However, Green Camuiβ showed a high fraction of lower oligomeric species represented by a peak at ~35 min (arrow 2).\n",

Content: <p> Circadian and seasonal rhythms are seen in many species, modulate several aspects of human physiology, including brain functions such as mood and cognition, and influence many neurological and psychiatric illnesses. However, there are few data regarding the genome-scale molecular correlates underlying these rhythms, especially in the human brain. Here, we report widespread, site-specific and interrelated diurnal and seasonal rhythms of gene expression in the human brain, and show their relationship with parallel rhythms of epigenetic modification including histone acetylation, and DNA methylation. We also identify transcription factor-binding sites that may drive these effects. Further, we demonstrate that Alzheimer's disease pathology disrupts these rhythms.\n",

Content: Compared to individuals without pathologic Alzheimer's disease, the diurnal transcript rhythms in individuals with pathologic Alzheimer's disease were advanced by nearly 1.5 h, while their seasonal rhythms were delayed by approximately half a month ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#f8\"> Fig. 8a–c </a> ). These differences were particularly pronounced for morning/fall- and evening/spring-acrophase transcripts and were less prominent for morning/spring- and evening/fall-acrophase transcripts, indicating a differential effect on different temporal classes of transcripts ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#S1\"> Supplementary Fig. 15 </a> ). Differences in rhythmic H3K9Ac were less pronounced. No significant differences in phase and amplitude between those with and without Alzheimer's disease were found when we considered all H3K9Ac peaks, although there were trends toward a slight delay and attenuation of diurnal rhythms ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#f8\"> Fig. 8d–f </a> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Results. Content: When individual temporal classes of H3K9Ac peaks were examined, diurnal rhythms of evening/fall-acrophase H3K9Ac peaks were both attenuated and delayed by nearly 1.5 h, with minimal changes in the other clusters of H3K9Ac peaks ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#S1\"> Supplementary Fig. 15 </a> ). Differences in DNA methylation rhythms were also modest, with a slight attenuation of the amplitude of diurnal rhythms ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#f8\"> Fig. 8g–i </a> ), in keeping with our prior report <a aria-describedby=\"b27\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b27\"> <sup> 27 </sup> </a> , particularly for evening-nadir DNA methylation sites ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#S1\"> Supplementary Fig. 15 </a> ).

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: The timing of diurnal and seasonal rhythms were related, suggesting shared regulatory mechanisms, and were strongly influenced by the local transcription factor-binding site environment, with shared groups of transcription factors associated with both diurnal and seasonal rhythms. Similarly, rhythms in the transcriptome and epigenome were temporally linked and associated with shared transcription factor-binding sites. Finally, differences in rhythms in the transcriptome and epigenome accompanied a pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may be an important contributor to, or consequence of, Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: </p> <p> Using a time of death analytic approach similar to the present study, two recent studies have reported diurnal rhythms of the expression of several hundred genes in several human brain regions <a aria-describedby=\"b18\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b18\"> <sup> 18 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b19\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b19\"> <sup> 19 </sup> </a> . Our results are largely concordant with these, both with regard to the overall bimodal clustering of diurnal acrophases and with regard to the specific timing of canonical circadian clock genes. The patterns of clock gene expression in our study are also concordant with our previous study in which we used microarrays to assess clock gene expression <a aria-describedby=\"b36\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b36\"> <sup> 36 </sup> </a> .\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Moreover, the set of genes identified as diurnally rhythmic in our data was strongly enriched for genes identified as diurnally rhythmic in two recent studies <a aria-describedby=\"b18\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b18\"> <sup> 18 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b19\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b19\"> <sup> 19 </sup> </a> . We extend these results by showing concurrent seasonal rhythms of gene expression, which had to our knowledge never before been demonstrated in any human solid organ. Like a recent study of seasonal rhythms of gene expression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and adipocytes <a aria-describedby=\"b26\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b26\"> <sup> 26 </sup> </a> , we found a bimodal pattern of seasonal gene expression. Interestingly, the peaks did not correspond to the peak and trough of seasonal photoperiod.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Rather, they were similar to a prior study in which the clusters of seasonal gene acrophases lagged the solstices by 1–2 months <a aria-describedby=\"b26\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b26\"> <sup> 26 </sup> </a> . This argues against photoperiod being the primary driver of these rhythms and suggests that other environmental (for example, temperature, whose peaks and troughs lag photoperiod in temperate climates) or behavioural factors (for example, physical activity), or even an endogenous circannual clock, as has been demonstrated in the European hamster <a aria-describedby=\"b20\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b20\"> <sup> 20 </sup> </a> , may be influencing these rhythms. Alternatively, these acrophases of gene expression may reflect the rate of change of photoperiod, which is fastest in the spring and summer.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: A recent study demonstrated that the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex perfusion response to certain cognitive tasks displays a seasonal acrophase in the fall, tracking the rate of change of photoperiod <a aria-describedby=\"b10\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b10\"> <sup> 10 </sup> </a> . </p> <p> We previously reported diurnal rhythms of DNA methylation in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. To our knowledge, circadian rhythms of histone modification previously have not been examined in the human brain. In this study, we found prominent diurnal rhythms of H3K9Ac, similar to those previously reported in mice <a aria-describedby=\"b15\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b15\"> <sup> 15 </sup> </a> . In addition, we found seasonal rhythms of H3K9Ac and DNA methylation, which have not, to our knowledge, been previously demonstrated in any mammalian tissue. Moreover, the timing of diurnal and seasonal rhythms varied with proximity to active TSS.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: This suggests that the timing of diurnal and seasonal regulation of H3K9Ac and DNA methylation may depend in part on the local transcriptional state and is in keeping with our previous finding that the timing of diurnal rhythms of DNA methylation depends on proximity to nearby active TSS <a aria-describedby=\"b27\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b27\"> <sup> 27 </sup> </a> . </p> <p> In model organisms, diurnal rhythms of histone modification and diurnal rhythms of transcription are related <a aria-describedby=\"b15\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b15\"> <sup> 15 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b16\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b16\"> <sup> 16 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b17\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b17\"> <sup> 17 </sup> </a> .\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: We found similar relationships in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with regions near expressed transcripts being relatively enriched for H3K9Ac peaks with acrophases and DNA methylation sites with nadirs coincident with or preceding peak transcript abundance. When we examined seasonal rhythms, a similar enrichment was seen, although here the enrichment was for DNA methylation acrophases coincident with, and H3K9Ac acrophases several months preceding, peak transcript abundance. This delay may suggest that although seasonal rhythms of H3K9Ac and DNA methylation may contribute to seasonal rhythms of transcript expression, other more proximate causal factors must also be contributing (for example, other epigenetic changes, derepression of repressors or other factors). </p> <p> We found a striking relationship between the timing of diurnal and seasonal rhythms for gene expression and H3K9Ac as well as, to a lesser degree, DNA methylation.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: This suggests that shared mechanisms regulate diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Indeed, overlap between mechanisms regulating circadian and circannual rhythmicity has been reported at the anatomic <a aria-describedby=\"b37\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b37\"> <sup> 37 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b38\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b38\"> <sup> 38 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b39\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b39\"> <sup> 39 </sup> </a> and genetic levels <a aria-describedby=\"b40\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b40\"> <sup> 40 </sup> </a> . In an exploratory analysis in this study, the effects of the local transcription factor-binding site environment on the timing of diurnal and seasonal rhythms overlapped, with the magnitude and direction of the effect of a transcription factor-binding site on diurnal rhythms predicting the magnitude and direction of its effect on seasonal rhythms.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Furthermore, the effect of a transcription factor-binding site on diurnal DNA methylation rhythms was a better predictor of its effect on transcript rhythms than its effect on H3K9Ac rhythms, raising the possibility that DNA methylation rhythms may mediate the link between specific transcription factors and diurnal and seasonal transcript rhythms. It is noteworthy that of the 11 transcription factors significantly associated with the timing of diurnal or seasonal rhythms, four transcription factors (EZH2 (ref. <a aria-describedby=\"b41\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b41\"> <sup> 41 </sup> </a> , RBBP5 (refs <a aria-describedby=\"b42\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b42\"> <sup> 42 </sup> </a> <sup> , </sup> <a aria-describedby=\"b43\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b43\"> <sup> 43 </sup> </a> ), SP1 (ref.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: <a aria-describedby=\"b44\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b44\"> <sup> 44 </sup> </a> ) and TBP <a aria-describedby=\"b45\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b45\"> <sup> 45 </sup> </a> ) have previously been implicated in the circadian machinery, reported to bind to members of the circadian machinery or found to be enriched in the promoter regions of clock-controlled genes. The role of the remaining seven genes in regulating seasonal or diurnal rhythms merits further study. One caveat in interpreting these results is that our binding site annotations were taken from human cell lines.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: We are not aware of genome-wide data sets using transcription factor ChIP-seq to generate similar annotations for human neocortex; the results of our hypothesis-generating analysis will guide targeted experiments to generate such data and will also guide <em> in vitro </em> validation efforts in human <em> in vitro </em> models, with a goal of further elucidating transcription factors regulating diurnal and seasonal epigenetic and transcriptional rhythms in the human brain. </p> <p> Concordant with our previous report <a aria-describedby=\"b27\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b27\"> <sup> 27 </sup> </a> , a pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was associated with attenuated diurnal rhythms of DNA methylation. It was also associated with attenuated diurnal rhythms of H3K9Ac in some but not other classes of H3K9 peaks, while no attenuation of diurnal transcript rhythms was seen.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: The selective attenuation of rhythms on some but not other clusters of H3K9Ac peaks and DNA methylation sites, and the sparing of the amplitude of diurnal transcript rhythms argues against the possibility that these effects reflect greater within-group diurnal dyssynchrony in individuals with Alzheimer's disease pathology compared to those without, which has been suggested as an explanation for the attenuation of diurnal transcript rhythms associated with depression <a aria-describedby=\"b18\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b18\"> <sup> 18 </sup> </a> . If this were the case, it should affect all diurnal rhythms equally. </p> <p> Compared to a prior analysis of a subset of these data <a aria-describedby=\"b27\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b27\"> <sup> 27 </sup> </a> , we found a less robust effect of Alzheimer's disease pathology on the phase of diurnal methylation rhythms once we adjusted for seasonal effects.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: This reflects in part the different reference time frame (midnight clock time versus sunrise time) used in the two analyses. Indeed, in secondary analyses, when we used clock time as the reference time, the phase delay associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology approached statistical significance. In addition, given the strong association between seasonal and diurnal rhythms that we have shown here, it is also likely that in the previous study, there was some confounding of diurnal effects by seasonal effects, highlighting the importance of adjusting for seasonal effects when examining diurnal rhythms. </p> <p> Although we found that pathologic Alzheimer's disease had modest effects on the timing of diurnal or seasonal epigenetic rhythms after controlling for other covariates, the diurnal transcript rhythms of individuals with Alzheimer's disease pathology were phase advanced by almost 1.5 h and their seasonal rhythms delayed by almost half a month.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: There are at least two possible explanations for this observation. First, rhythms of transcription reflect not only DNA methylation and H3K9Ac but also other epigenetic marks, and other transcriptional events such as RNA polymerase binding <a aria-describedby=\"b17\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b17\"> <sup> 17 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b46\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b46\"> <sup> 46 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b47\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b47\"> <sup> 47 </sup> </a> . Alzheimer's disease pathology may alter the phase relationship between rhythms of H3K9Ac, DNA methylation and RNA transcription by affecting these other processes.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Second, post-transcriptional processes appear to play an important role in determining the timing of rhythms of transcript abundance <a aria-describedby=\"b17\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b17\"> <sup> 17 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b46\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b46\"> <sup> 46 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b47\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b47\"> <sup> 47 </sup> </a> . MicroRNAs may play an important role here <a aria-describedby=\"b48\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b48\"> <sup> 48 </sup> </a> as may rhythms of alternative splicing <a aria-describedby=\"b49\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b49\"> <sup> 49 </sup> </a> . Alzheimer's disease pathology may alter post-transcriptional RNA processing, further decoupling rhythms of H3K9Ac and DNA methylation from rhythms of transcript abundance. </p> <p> In considering these data, a few methodological points are worth noting.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: As in other recent studies <a aria-describedby=\"b18\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b18\"> <sup> 18 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b19\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b19\"> <sup> 19 </sup> </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"b26\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#b26\"> <sup> 26 </sup> </a> , we inferred group-level average diurnal and seasonal rhythms. Because ethical considerations preclude serial sampling of neocortical tissue from living human subjects, we only had one sample per individual, making exploration of individual level differences impossible. In addition, we had no data on behavioural state (awake versus asleep), medical status, environmental conditions (light, temperature) or activities proximate to death. Therefore, we cannot distinguish diurnal or seasonal rhythms driven by intrinsic circadian or circannual clocks, from those reflective of rhythms in environmental conditions, social environment, behaviour or medical health.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Third, humans experience both natural and artificial light, the timing of which may change by season. Moreover, sleep timing, which is a major influence on exposure to darkness, is linked to clock time and associated social schedules rather than natural light exposure. These considerations complicate the selection of an appropriate reference time for diurnal rhythms, and also the interpretation of diurnal and seasonal rhythmicity. However, our results were robust: results were consistent between our primary analytic approach using sunrise time (reflective of the timing of natural light exposure) as the reference time for diurnal analyses, and our secondary analyses using clock time (linked to artificial light, and to the timing of sleep and social schedules) or the midpoint of the dark period (invariant across seasons) as the reference time.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Finally, although this is the largest study to date to examine diurnal rhythms of gene expression in the human brain and it provided ample statistical power for group-level comparisons, our study lacked statistical power to draw firm conclusions about diurnal and seasonal rhythms at the individual chromosomal locus level, and, therefore, we did not pursue locus-level analyses. </p> <p> This study also had a number of methodological strengths. We measured transcript expression, H3K9Ac and DNA methylation genome-wide in the same samples, allowing the inference of the temporal relationships between them. In addition, data were obtained at all circadian times and dates of death, and at a relatively high temporal density, allowing greater precision than would be provided by less frequent sampling. Moreover, as all participants were organ donors, both time and date of death were relatively accurately determined, and post-mortem intervals were short.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion. Content: Also, we simultaneously considered both diurnal and seasonal effects in the same model, allowing us to characterize their independent contributions. Further, the participants were clinically well characterized, allowing us to examine the impact of key brain disorders like pathologic Alzheimer's disease, on human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex diurnal and seasonal genetic and epigenetic rhythms. Finally, the brain tissue was obtained from two prospective cohort studies with extraordinarily high rates of follow-up and autopsy, minimizing bias due to selective attrition. </p> <p> Considered together, these results highlight a multilevel architecture of interrelated diurnal and seasonal rhythms of gene expression and epigenetic modification in the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with shared regulatory mechanisms.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Moreover, they suggest that changes in the amplitude, timing or phase relationships of these molecular rhythms may be contributors to, or consequences of, Alzheimer's disease pathology. Larger human studies sampling multiple brain regions, or even multiple organs, are needed to provide locus-level spatial resolution while linking these molecular diurnal and seasonal events to key nodes (such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus) thought to play roles in circadian and circannual rhythmicity. Meanwhile, work <em> in vitro </em> and in model organisms is needed to better delineate regulatory mechanisms suggested by our analyses. </p> <p> Data from participants in two ongoing longitudinal cohort studies of older persons were included in this study: the Rush MAP and the ROS.

At the time of the current analyses, 680 ROS participants and 726 MAP participants had died and had autopsies performed. Because all ROS and MAP participants are organ donors, date and time of death are generally well captured in the vast majority of participants.

Compared to individuals without pathologic Alzheimer's disease, the diurnal transcript rhythms in individuals with pathologic Alzheimer's disease were advanced by nearly 1.5 h, while their seasonal rhythms were delayed by approximately half a month ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#f8\"> Fig.\n",

      "Section Title: Discussion. Content: <p> Genome-scale analysis of over 750 post-mortem human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex samples revealed the presence of diurnal and seasonal rhythms in the human brain transcriptome, H3K9 acetylome and DNA methylome. The timing of diurnal and seasonal rhythms were related, suggesting shared regulatory mechanisms, and were strongly influenced by the local transcription factor-binding site environment, with shared groups of transcription factors associated with both diurnal and seasonal rhythms. Similarly, rhythms in the transcriptome and epigenome were temporally linked and associated with shared transcription factor-binding sites. Finally, differences in rhythms in the transcriptome and epigenome accompanied a pathological diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, suggesting that they may be an important contributor to, or consequence of, Alzheimer's disease pathology.\n",
      "Section Title: Discussion. Content: Moreover, they suggest that changes in the amplitude, timing or phase relationships of these molecular rhythms may be contributors to, or consequences of, Alzheimer's disease pathology. Larger human studies sampling multiple brain regions, or even multiple organs, are needed to provide locus-level spatial resolution while linking these molecular diurnal and seasonal events to key nodes (such as the suprachiasmatic nucleus) thought to play roles in circadian and circannual rhythmicity. Meanwhile, work <em> in vitro </em> and in model organisms is needed to better delineate regulatory mechanisms suggested by our analyses. </p>\n",

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: <p> Many proteins work together with others in groups called complexes in order to achieve a specific function. Discovering protein complexes is important for understanding biological processes and predict protein functions in living organisms. Large-scale and throughput techniques have made possible to compile protein-protein interaction networks (PPI networks), which have been used in several computational approaches for detecting protein complexes. Those predictions might guide future biologic experimental research. Some approaches are topology-based, where highly connected proteins are predicted to be complexes; some propose different clustering algorithms using partitioning, overlaps among clusters for networks modeled with unweighted or weighted graphs; and others use density of clusters and information based on protein functionality. However, some schemes still require much processing time or the quality of their results can be improved.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Furthermore, most of the results obtained with computational tools are not accompanied by an analysis of false positives. We propose an effective and efficient mining algorithm for discovering highly connected subgraphs, which is our base for defining protein complexes. Our representation is based on transforming the PPI network into a directed acyclic graph that reduces the number of represented edges and the search space for discovering subgraphs. Our approach considers weighted and unweighted PPI networks. We compare our best alternative using PPI networks from <em> Saccharomyces cerevisiae </em> (yeast) and <em> Homo sapiens </em> (human) with state-of-the-art approaches in terms of clustering, biological metrics and execution times, as well as three gold standards for yeast and two for human.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Furthermore, we analyze false positive predicted complexes searching the PDBe (Protein Data Bank in Europe) database in order to identify matching protein complexes that have been purified and structurally characterized. Our analysis shows that more than 50 yeast protein complexes and more than 300 human protein complexes found to be false positives according to our prediction method, i.e., not described in the gold standard complex databases, in fact contain protein complexes that have been characterized structurally and documented in PDBe. We also found that some of these protein complexes have recently been classified as part of a Periodic Table of Protein Complexes.

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: </p> <p> Understanding biological processes at a cellular and system levels is an important task in all living organisms. Proteins are crucial components in many biological processes, such as metabolic and immune processes, transport, signaling, and enzymatic catalysis. Most proteins bind to other proteins in groups of interacting molecules, forming protein complexes to carry out biological functions. Berggård et al. [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref001\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref001\"> 1 </a> ] showed that more than 80% of proteins work in complexes. Moreover, many proteins are multifunctional, in the sense that they are part of different complexes according to the specific function required in the system.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction. Content: The discovery of protein complexes is of paramount relevance since it helps discover the structure-function relationships of protein-protein interaction networks (PPI networks), improving the understanding of the protein roles in different functions. Furthermore, understanding the roles of proteins in diverse complexes is important for many diseases, since biological research has shown that the deletion of some highly connected proteins in a network can have lethal effects on organisms [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref002\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref002\"> 2 </a> ]. </p> <p> Technological advances in biological experimental techniques have made possible the compilation of large-scale PPI networks for many organisms.

Some of these techniques include functional annotation analysis as a pre-processing or post-processing step for predicted complexes [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref024\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref024\"> 24 </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref025\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref025\"> 25 </a> ]; others include functional information in the complex prediction algorithms [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref007\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref007\"> 7 </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref026\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref026\"> 26 </a> ].\n",

In these approaches it is important both the definition of the similarity measure and the clustering algorithm, which should support overlap on weighted graphs. Post-processing strategies apply functional knowledge on predicted complexes, which is also biased by the quality of the predicted complexes. Applying functional annotations during the complex discovery is an interesting approach, but it is also biased to the quality of the functional similarity definition and the algorithm time complexity. </p> <p> In order to validate predicted complexes, all computational strategies compare their results with gold standards used as references.\n",

Content: Currently, CYC2008 [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref027\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref027\"> 27 </a> ] is the gold standard that reflects the current state of knowledge for yeast. This catalog contains 408 manually curated heteromeric protein complexes reliably supported by small-scale experiments reported in the literature. In fact CYC2008 was proposed as an update of MIPS (Munich Information Center of Protein Sequences) database [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref028\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref028\"> 28 </a> ], which was used as a reference until 2008. Another up-to-date reference for yeast is available at the SGD (Saccharomyces Genome Database) [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref029\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref029\"> 29 </a> ]. </p> <p> The prediction algorithms are important tools for updating the gold standards so that they reflect the latest biological knowledge.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction. Content: For example, one of the strategies used for building CYC2008 consisted in using the MCL (Markov Clustering) [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref012\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref012\"> 12 </a> ] algorithm for predicting protein complexes. This provided some complexes that were not in MIPS. Even though MCL is a very reliable algorithm, it does not support overlaps [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref019\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref019\"> 19 </a> ]. Using better prediction algorithms can therefore improve the current state of knowledge. Still, even though there are several prediction tools, there is no single method with dominating performance in terms of prediction quality and execution time for both small and large PPI networks. </p> <p> We propose an effective and efficient strategy for predicting protein complexes, using dense subgraphs built from complete bipartite graph patterns.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction. Content: Even though finding densely connected subgraphs is not a new idea and surely may not be the optimal property to look for in order to identify protein complexes (indeed, it is unknown which is that optimal property), this approach makes sense from different points of view. </p> <p> First, it is biologically intuitive and evolutionarily logical to expect a low number of proteins to participate in many interactions, especially considering that such proteins should act as good control points for multiple related biological functions. This case is common in currently known biological networks and complexes and can explain why PPI networks have characteristics of “small-world” graphs.\n",

Content: Second, analyzing the structural assembly of known complexes of more than two different proteins [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref030\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref030\"> 30 </a> , <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref031\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref031\"> 31 </a> ], the majority of them implies highly connected protein nodes and cliques (see, for instance, all examples in Figure 3 of Marsh et al., 2015 [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref031\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref031\"> 31 </a> ], or Figure 6 in Ahnert et al., 2015 [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref030\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref030\"> 30 </a> ]), and there seems to be only a few ways in which protein complexes assemble.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction | Our contribution. Content: Third, protein complexes are thought to follow a few evolutionarily conserved ordered assembly pathways [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref032\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref032\"> 32 </a> ], which in the practice limits how many individual PPI interactions can be experimentally demonstrated for a given complex and how they can be translated into real complexes. In this scenario, looking for densely connected subgraphs in a PPI network may not be optimal, but it is a property representative of the new discoveries in complex assembly and it is efficient to at least screen and identify putative complexes. This has been demonstrated previously by the effective use of this approach in other algorithms, such as ClusterONE [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref011\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref011\"> 11 </a> ] and COREPEEL [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref018\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref018\"> 18 </a> ].\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction | Our contribution. Content: </p> <p> From an algorithmic point of view, our dense subgraph definition allows us to discover cliques and complete bipartite graphs that overlap. Since finding all maximal cliques in a graph is NP-complete [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref033\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref033\"> 33 </a> ], we propose a transformation of the input PPI network into an acyclic graph on which we design fast mining heuristics for finding dense subgraphs. </p> <p> Our approach is somehow related to ClusterONE [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref011\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref011\"> 11 </a> ], in the sense that ClusterONE also uses a greedy heuristic that builds groups of vertices with high cohesiveness starting at seed vertices. In our approach, we first reduce the complexity of dense subgraph mining with the construction of the the acyclic graph from an input graph representing a PPI network.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction | Our contribution. Content: Then, we apply two different objective functions; the first enables the fast traversal of the acyclic graph and the second is used for detecting maximal dense subgraphs. COREPEEL, on the other hand, is related to our algorithm in the sense that it is also based on detecting dense subgraphs, but their approach uses core decomposition for finding quasi cliques in the graph ( <em> core </em> ) and then removes nodes with minimum degree ( <em> peel </em> ). Other approaches that also predict overlapping protein complexes are GMFTP [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref026\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref026\"> 26 </a> ] and DCAFP [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref017\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref017\"> 17 </a> ].

ClusterONE and COREPEEL provide good results and are also fast; however, our approach provides better results in terms of MMR, biological metrics and number of correct protein complexes based on gold standars in most of the PPI networks we analyzed in the manuscript. On the other hand, GMFTP and DCAFP provide good results but are several orders of magnitude slower than our approach. </p> <p> As said, updating the gold standards is an important application of complex prediction tools. However, most prediction approaches do not discuss the predicted complexes that are false positives with respect to the current complexes in the references.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Introduction | Our contribution. Content: These predicted complexes are not necessarily incorrect results; they can actually be new complexes that have not yet been discovered, or can be part of biological evidence not captured in the construction of the current gold standards. </p> <p> In our work, we analyze the false-positive protein complexes predicted by our method (i.e., complexes not described in the gold standards), and report on our findings.

Our approach enables us to find dense subgraphs that usually overlap among them. We then describe different alternatives for mapping dense subgraphs to protein complexes. </p> <p> Since the interactions among proteins in a PPI are symmetric, these networks are usually modeled as undirected graphs, where proteins are vertices and interactions between proteins are edges.

Therefore, <em> u </em> appears in the adjacency list of <em> v </em> and <em> v </em> appears in the adjacency list of <em> u </em> .

Then, our algorithm starts from each node in DAPG, with an initial <em> vertexSet </em> of size at most <em> e </em> , and walks some path upwards to the root, performing at most <em> h </em> steps.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Materials and methods. Content: At each step it must compute the distance traveler function, which in our examples costs <em> O </em> (1) or <em> O </em> ( <em> e </em> ) time. It also intersects the <em> vertexSet </em> of the new node with the current candidates, in time <em> O </em> ( <em> e </em> ), and determines whether or not to keep the current node in the set <em> C </em> . All the criteria we use for the latter can be computed in time <em> O </em> ( <em> e </em> ). Therefore, the total time of this process is <em> O </em> ( <em> nhe </em> ). </p> <p> Let <em> m </em> be the maximum number of maximal subgraphs produced along the process. Once the new subgraph is produced, we compare it with the <em> O </em> ( <em> m </em> ) current maximal subgraphs, looking for those that include or are included in the new one, in order to remove the included ones (or the new one). This costs <em> O </em> ( <em> nme </em> ) time.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Materials and methods. Content: </p> <p> The total cost is therefore <em> O </em> ( <em> ne </em> ( <em> h </em> + <em> m </em> )). This is <em> O </em> ( <em> n </em> <sup> 3 </sup> ) in the worst case, but much less in practice. For example, in Collins we have <em> n </em> = 1,622, <em> e </em> = 127, <em> h </em> = 187, and <em> m </em> = 12, and therefore <em> ne </em> ( <em> h </em> + <em> m </em> ) is 25,273 <em> n </em> , which is 100 times less than <em> n </em> <sup> 3 </sup> = 2,630,884 <em> n </em> </p> <p> We define protein complexes from the DSGs we discover in PPI networks. Since we obtain at most one DSG starting at each node in DAPG, our algorithm is able to obtain DSGs that are in overlap. Let a parameter <em> minSize </em> define the minimum size of a candidate complex. Then, each DSG( <em> S </em> , <em> C </em> ) is considered as a candidate complex with nodes <em> S </em> ∪ <em> C </em> whenever | <em> S </em> ∪ <em> C </em> | ≥ <em> minSize </em> .\n",

For instance, Acc penalizes predicted complexes that do not match any of the reference complexes, when some of the predicted complexes might indeed be undiscovered complexes. </p> <p> We also used MMR measure, introduced by Nepusz et al. [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref011\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref011\"> 11 </a> ] to avoid the penalization of accuracy metrics over clusters with significant overlaps. MMR is based on a maximal one-to-one mapping between predicted and reference complexes. MMR represents a bipartite graph where one set of nodes is formed by the predicted complexes and the other by the reference complexes. Each edge has a weight representing the overlap score between the two vertices. The maximum weighted bipartite matching on this graph measures the quality of predicted complexes with respect to the reference complexes.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Experimental setup. Content: The MMR score is given by the sum of the weights of the edges on this graph divided by the number of reference complexes. MMR offers a good comparison between predicted and reference complexes, penalizing those cases when reference complexes are found in two predicted complexes with high overlap. </p> <p> In order to compute the MMR ( <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.e010\"> Eq 4 </a> ), ClusterONE first matches each reference complex ( <em> rc </em> <sub> <em> i </em> </sub> ) to a predicted complex ( <em> pc </em> <sub> <em> j </em> </sub> ) that maximizes the average <em> OS </em> over all reference complexes (considering a minimum <em> OS </em> ≥ 0.2). </p> <p> One important feature of PPI networks is that they are incomplete and noisy. Biological processes for discovering protein interactions are not error free. In consequence, PPI networks might miss proteins with their interactions or include interactions that are not real.\n",

This fact can be observed by looking at the proteins that are in PPI networks and the proteins that are in the reference. Nepusz et al. [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref011\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref011\"> 11 </a> ] consider the three following cases for proteins in PPI networks and the reference. </p> <p> Proteins appearing in the PPI and in the reference. </p> <p> Proteins appearing in the PPI, but not in the reference. </p> <p> Proteins appearing in the reference, but not in the PPI. </p> <p> Evaluating mining algorithms for the cases (1) and (2) is straightforward since protein interaction can be captured by the mining algorithm.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Experimental setup. Content: Complexes found in case (2) might owe to mistakes on the mining algorithm or incompleteness of the reference, therefore this last case might require an analysis of the false positives generated by the mining algorithm. However, finding complexes in case (3) is impossible for any mining algorithm based on clustering. A possible simple solution to evaluate a mining algorithm would be not to consider reference complexes containing proteins unknown in the PPI, but if these protein interactions are missing in large predicted complexes then there might not be a good reason to eliminate the complete complex. Based on these considerations Nepusz et al. [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref011\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref011\"> 11 </a> ] propose filtering the references for evaluating a mining algorithm. The procedure is given as follows: </p> <p> Identify all proteins that had at least one known interaction with other proteins in the input PPI.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Experimental setup. Content: </p> <p> For each complex in the reference, identify its proteins and compute the set intersection with all proteins in the input PPI. </p> <p> If the set intersection size of a reference complex in the previous step is less than half of the size of the complete reference complex, such reference complex is eliminated because too many proteins are missing in the input PPI, and even if this complex is predicted might not be because of the quality of the algorithm. </p> <p> If the set intersection size of a reference complex is greater than half of the size of the complete reference complex, the reference complex is considered but all proteins that are unknown to the PPI are eliminated. This action does not improve the quality of the mining algorithm since all algorithms are assessed on the same reference and those proteins could not be inferred anyways.\n",

Content: </p> <p> In order to provide a fair way to compare our approach against other proposed methods, we used the implementation just described [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref011\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref011\"> 11 </a> ], available at <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"https://github.com/jboscolo/RH/find/master\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> https://github.com/jboscolo/RH/find/master </a> .

In the case of GMFTP we use default parameters ( <em> τ </em> = 0.2, <em> K </em> = 1000, <em> λ </em> = 4, <em> T </em> = 400, <em> ρ </em> = 1 <em> e </em> − 6) and set <em> repeat </em> _ <em> times </em> = 10 instead of the default, which was 100. With this change we could actually get results in a little more than 12 hours for each PPI network. For CFinder the most sensible parameter is <em> t </em> , which is the allowed time to spend in the detection for clique search per node. We used <em> t </em> = 1 and <em> t </em> = 10 and took the best result. Since GMFTP took too much execution time for small PPI networks (over 12 hours) we did not try to run it with larger PPIs. Also, we were unable to execute CFinder with the two largest PPI networks, and with DCAFP we have a memory error with Biogrid-human, therefore we do not report results for these cases.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Results. Content: The main parameter for executing DSDCluster is the number of clusters ( <em> K </em> ). We executed DSDCluster with <em> K </em> between 100 and 700, increasing by 100 in Collins, Krogan Core, Krogan Extended, and Gavin. In DIP-yeast we reach <em> K </em> = 1600. For Bigrid-yeast, HPRD and Biogrid-human we define <em> K </em> = 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500.

We evaluated clustering metrics and biological metrics. We observed that we are able to obtain the best MMR measure in Collins, Gavin, DIP-yeast and Biogrid-yeast PPI networks using the three gold standards and our combinations. In the Krogan Core PPI we obtain the second best after GMFTP, which is the best for the three gold standards, but we are better in the combined references. In the Krogan Extended PPI we are best using CYC2008, GMFTP is best with SGD and COREPEEL is best in MIPS, in the merged gold standards COREPEEL is the best, and we are second. We also observed that, for most human PPIs, COREPEEL is the best and we are second. We also report execution times, where all methods were executed locally, except COREPEEL, which provide the execution through its web site and report execution time as a result. SPICI is the fastest method.\n",

We first evaluated and compared the protein complex overlap as described earlier using cumulative histograms.

      "Section Title: Abstract | Results | False positive analysis. Content: In this work, we analyze the reported false positives by looking into curated biological databases such as PDBe (Protein Database Bank in Europe, <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe </a> ) which contain information about protein complexes that have purified and structurally characterized. Most of the protein complexes in PDBe are small and are absent in gold standards such as CYC2008 and CORUM, mainly because these gold standards have not been updated recently. In addition, PDBe does not have directly available a repository of all the protein complexes it contains. Therefore, here we propose an automated procedure to query the database to find out whether sets of genes are registered as purified complexes in PDBe.\n",

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Our approach is based on modeling PPI networks as directed acyclic graphs, which allowed us to design an efficient mining heuristic for detecting overlapping dense subgraphs considering weighted and unweighted PPI networks. We define protein complexes based on dense subgraphs that usually overlap. An important advantage of our approach is that it enables the easy extension of new traveler and objective functions. New traveler functions might improve the mining process for discovering dense subgraghs and new objective functions might include biological knowledge to discover subgraphs with biological significance. Therefore, further extensions to our framework are based on adding biological information that might improve the discovery of protein complexes or other protein relationships of biological relevance.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract | Discussion and conclusions. Content: </p> <p> We compare our results with state-of-the-art techniques and show that we provide good performance in terms of clustering using different gold standards and biological metrics, as well as good execution times. We show that our method is able to achieve very good results in terms of matching perfectly ( <em> OS </em> = 1.0) protein complexes in the gold standards. We also provide a post-processing analysis to study false positive complexes that contain proteins in PPI networks that are absent in the gold standards. In order to study false positives, we consider the information available on protein complexes that have been purified and structurally characterized in PDBe. We used this information together with a recent approach that proposes a periodic table for protein complexes that studies different topologies according to the subunits that compose protein complexes.\n",
      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: In this study we discovered that more than 50 yeast complexes and more than 300 of false positive human complexes, not present in gold standards, have actually been already characterized and their information is available in PDBe. Many of these complexes have also been found as having an associated type in the periodic table of protein complexes [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref030\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref030\"> 30 </a> ]. We propose these “new” real complexes discovered by our approach and already present in such structural databases, to be considered as new candidates for inclusion in the gold standards of protein complexes. Considering these results, we present our list of predicted false-positive protein complexes to the scientific community, conjecturing that at least part of them could be, in fact, true real complexes awaiting to be studied and characterized. </p> <p> Table A1: Mining algorithm.

      "Section Title: Abstract. Content: Furthermore, we analyze false positive predicted complexes searching the PDBe (Protein Data Bank in Europe) database in order to identify matching protein complexes that have been purified and structurally characterized. Our analysis shows that more than 50 yeast protein complexes and more than 300 human protein complexes found to be false positives according to our prediction method, i.e., not described in the gold standard complex databases, in fact contain protein complexes that have been characterized structurally and documented in PDBe. We also found that some of these protein complexes have recently been classified as part of a Periodic Table of Protein Complexes. The latest version of our software is publicly available at <a class=\"usa-link usa-link--external\" href=\"http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5297314.v1\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"> http://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5297314.v1 </a> . </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Introduction. Content: <p> Understanding biological processes at a cellular and system levels is an important task in all living organisms. Proteins are crucial components in many biological processes, such as metabolic and immune processes, transport, signaling, and enzymatic catalysis. Most proteins bind to other proteins in groups of interacting molecules, forming protein complexes to carry out biological functions. Berggård et al. [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref001\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref001\"> 1 </a> ] showed that more than 80% of proteins work in complexes. Moreover, many proteins are multifunctional, in the sense that they are part of different complexes according to the specific function required in the system.\n",
      "Section Title: Introduction | Our contribution. Content: Further, our automatic false positive analysis shows that many of our false positives in fact contain small curated protein complexes that are reported in PDBe and not found in gold standards: more than 50 on yeast and 300 on human proteins. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Our contribution. Content: <p> We propose an effective and efficient strategy for predicting protein complexes, using dense subgraphs built from complete bipartite graph patterns. Even though finding densely connected subgraphs is not a new idea and surely may not be the optimal property to look for in order to identify protein complexes (indeed, it is unknown which is that optimal property), this approach makes sense from different points of view. </p> <p> First, it is biologically intuitive and evolutionarily logical to expect a low number of proteins to participate in many interactions, especially considering that such proteins should act as good control points for multiple related biological functions. This case is common in currently known biological networks and complexes and can explain why PPI networks have characteristics of “small-world” graphs.\n",
      "Section Title: Materials and methods. Content: <p> In this section we present our graph definitions for modeling PPI networks, formulate the problem of finding dense subgraphs, and describe the algorithms for detecting dense subgraphs. Our approach enables us to find dense subgraphs that usually overlap among them. We then describe different alternatives for mapping dense subgraphs to protein complexes. </p> <p> Since the interactions among proteins in a PPI are symmetric, these networks are usually modeled as undirected graphs, where proteins are vertices and interactions between proteins are edges. We represent a PPI network with adjacency lists, where each adjacency list contains the set of neighbors of a protein. In order to find complexes, we represent each undirected edge { <em> u </em> , <em> v </em> } as two directed edges ( <em> u </em> , <em> v </em> ) and ( <em> v </em> , <em> u </em> ).\n",
      "Section Title: Materials and methods. Content: Therefore, <em> u </em> appears in the adjacency list of <em> v </em> and <em> v </em> appears in the adjacency list of <em> u </em> . The PPI network is then modeled as a directed graph <em> G </em> = ( <em> V </em> , <em> E </em> , <em> w </em> ), where <em> V </em> is the set of vertices (proteins), <em> E </em> ⊆ <em> V </em> × <em> V </em> is the set of edges (protein-protein interactions), and <em> w </em> : <em> E </em> → [0, 1] is a function that maps an edge to a real number between 0 and 1 that represents the probability that an interaction is real. </p> <p> We first represent a protein-protein interaction network as a graph, where the protein names of the network are represented as vertices in the graph with numeric ids. Thus, each protein name must be mapped to a unique numeric id.\n",
      "Section Title: Materials and methods. Content: Mapping protein names to numeric ids can be done using any <em> Node ordering algorithm </em> , such as random, lexicographic, by degree, BFS traversal, and DFS traversal, among others. </p> <p> Our algorithm for finding dense subgraphs looks for cliques and complete bipartite subgraphs in the PPI network. The process of finding good dense subgraphs is run over an acyclic graph called <em> DAPG </em> , which is built from the input PPI network.\n",
      "Section Title: Materials and methods.

      "Section Title: Graph models for PPI networks. Content: <p> Since the interactions among proteins in a PPI are symmetric, these networks are usually modeled as undirected graphs, where proteins are vertices and interactions between proteins are edges. We represent a PPI network with adjacency lists, where each adjacency list contains the set of neighbors of a protein. In order to find complexes, we represent each undirected edge { <em> u </em> , <em> v </em> } as two directed edges ( <em> u </em> , <em> v </em> ) and ( <em> v </em> , <em> u </em> ). Therefore, <em> u </em> appears in the adjacency list of <em> v </em> and <em> v </em> appears in the adjacency list of <em> u </em> .\n",

Mapping protein names to numeric ids can be performed using any node ordering algorithm. In this work, we use six different mappings. <em> First </em> maps protein names to numeric ids in the order in which proteins are read from the PPI network. <em> Lexicographic </em> sorts the protein names and then assigns the numeric ids in that order. <em> Degree </em> sorts the proteins by decreasing degree in the network and then assigns the numeric ids in that order. <em> Random </em> maps protein names to numeric ids randomly. Finally, <em> BFS </em> and <em> DFS </em> map proteins names based on the breadth-first or depth-first search network traversal, respectively. </p> <p> The algorithm we propose for discovering dense subgraphs proceeds in two phases.\n",
      "Section Title: Algorithms. Content: The first phase builds an acyclic graph DAPG from <em> G </em> , using a total ordering function in the adjacency lists. As mentioned, we propose two total ordering functions: ID and FREQUENCY. The second phase consists in discovering dense subgraphs based on optimizing two objective functions: one guides the traversal on DAPG and the other specifies which nodes to choose. </p> <p> Lemma 1 enables the detection of dense subgraphs from DAPG, however, even for a given path <em> P </em> , finding all the possible sets <em> R </em> in the path requires time exponential in the number of nodes in the path. Finding the best paths <em> P </em> in DAPG is also exponential-time. Instead, we design an efficient mining heuristic for discovering dense subgraphs in DAPG. </p> <p> The main mining heuristic is based on finding at most one dense subgraph starting at each node in DAPG. This approach enables us to find dense subgraphs that might overlap.\n",

We find a promising path in DAPG starting from a given node <em> u </em> using an <em> inverse traveler function </em> given in Definition 3. </p> <p> The core of our mining technique starts at each node <em> v </em> in DAPG and walks its way to the previous node in the path up to a root. Along the path, we maintain in set <em> S </em> the intersection of the <em> vertexSet </em> of the nodes in a subset of the visited nodes (those which provide a better partial <em> DSG </em> ), while we maintain in set <em> C </em> the <em> labels </em> of the nodes of the selected subset.

      "Section Title: Biological measures. Content: <p> Besides clustering measures, we consider biological relevance metrics. In this context we used <em> Colocalization </em> and <em> Gene Ontology Similarity (GoSim) </em> . <em> Colocalization </em> measures the relationship of proteins based on where they are located in the cell and organism. The idea is that since protein complexes are assembled to perform a specific function, proteins within the same complex tend to be close to each other [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref037\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref037\"> 37 </a> ]. The idea of <em> GoSim </em> comes from the Gene Ontology Annotations, which basically describe the functions in which proteins work. Since protein complexes are formed to perform on specific functions, proteins forming a complex tend to share similar functionality [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref038\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref038\"> 38 </a> ].\n",

Specifically, we used the ClusterONE implementation of Acc and MMR metrics and we added support for FMeasure to compare all clustering techniques considered for comparison. ClusterONE implementation eliminates reference complexes that contain more than 50% of proteins that are unknown (i.e., proteins that are absent in the PPI network) and removes unknown proteins of complexes that contain less than 50% of such proteins. </p>\n",
      "Section Title: Parameter tuning. Content: <p> First, we define different node ordering algorithms to map the protein names to unique numeric ids in the graph. We consider the node ordering algorithms already described: <em> First </em> , <em> Random </em> , <em> Degree </em> , <em> Lexicographic </em> , <em> BFS </em> , and <em> DFS </em> . </p> <p> We compared our results according to the different parameters we have in our algorithms. We present a summary of the main parameters we provide in our approach in <a class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.t004\"> Table 4 </a> . With <em> Protein Mapping </em> we specify the text file describing the mapping from proteins to numeric ids. With <em> Graph Type </em> we specify the type of graph, which can be undirected unweighted, <em> UNONE </em> , or undirected weighted, <em> USYM </em> .\n",
      "Section Title: Parameter tuning. Content: With alternative <em> f </em> <sub> <em> obj </em> </sub> , we choose an objective function <em> f </em> <sub> <em> obj </em> </sub> based on weighted density in the mining algorithm. to detect <em> best </em> dense subgraphs (the default function, <em> f </em> <sub> <em> obj </em> </sub> = | <em> S </em> ∩ <em> C </em> |, is used with option <em> UNONE </em> ). With <em> Sorting </em> we specify the sorting algorithm of adjacency lists; it can be by ID or by FREQUENCY. Finally, <em> Grouping </em> allows us to define how predicted complexes are built based on candidate complexes. Alternatives are <em> UNION </em> , which takes the union <em> C </em> <sub> <em> x </em> </sub> ∪ <em> C </em> <sub> <em> y </em> </sub> of the complexes where <em> OS </em> ( <em> C </em> <sub> <em> x </em> </sub> , <em> C </em> <sub> <em> y </em> </sub> ) &gt; 0.8, and <em> NONE </em> , where predicted complexes are defined as the candidate complexes.\n",
      "Section Title: Parameter tuning. Content: Other parameters include the minimum size, <em> minSize </em> , of any complex, the type of dense subgraph (only clique or dense subgraphs) and an alternative mapping for input PPI networks. </p> <p> In order to compare our results we tried different node ordering (protein mapping) algorithms and different parameters in each experiment, given in the following format: DAPG <em> GTypeDM-rSorting-fGrouping </em> <em> (Protein Mapping) </em> . In this format <em> GType </em> can be <em> UU </em> (undirected unweighted) or <em> UW </em> (undirected weighted), <em> DM </em> can be any of the density measures; <em> Sorting </em> can be adjacency lists sorted by frequency (F) or ID (I); and <em> Grouping </em> is the way we group candidate complexes to generate predicted complexes, defined by the union set (U) or none (N).\n",

We observe that using <em> BFS </em> and <em> DFS </em> traversals provides best results in seven of the eight PPI networks we tested. Also the total order function <em> Sorting by ID </em> is very effective with these protein mappings, achieving best results in six of the eight PPI networks. </p> <p> We also explore the impact of adding random edges into a PPI networks.

      "Section Title: False positive analysis. Content: <p> Predicting protein complexes is challenging because PPI networks are noisy and incomplete, and references are also incomplete and not systematically updated. All prediction techniques report false positives (i.e., predicted complexes that are not in references), although they can be real complexes not included in references or not discovered yet. In this work, we perform an automatic false positive evaluation of predicted complexes for yeast and human that are absent in available references. Our goal is to see if the reported false positives contain interesting gene sets.\n",

      "Section Title: Discussion and conclusions. Content: <p> We have introduced a novel scheme for detecting protein complexes. Our approach is based on modeling PPI networks as directed acyclic graphs, which allowed us to design an efficient mining heuristic for detecting overlapping dense subgraphs considering weighted and unweighted PPI networks. We define protein complexes based on dense subgraphs that usually overlap. An important advantage of our approach is that it enables the easy extension of new traveler and objective functions. New traveler functions might improve the mining process for discovering dense subgraghs and new objective functions might include biological knowledge to discover subgraphs with biological significance. Therefore, further extensions to our framework are based on adding biological information that might improve the discovery of protein complexes or other protein relationships of biological relevance.\n",
      "Section Title: Discussion and conclusions. Content: In this study we discovered that more than 50 yeast complexes and more than 300 of false positive human complexes, not present in gold standards, have actually been already characterized and their information is available in PDBe. Many of these complexes have also been found as having an associated type in the periodic table of protein complexes [ <a aria-describedby=\"pone.0183460.ref030\" class=\"usa-link\" href=\"#pone.0183460.ref030\"> 30 </a> ]. We propose these “new” real complexes discovered by our approach and already present in such structural databases, to be considered as new candidates for inclusion in the gold standards of protein complexes. Considering these results, we present our list of predicted false-positive protein complexes to the scientific community, conjecturing that at least part of them could be, in fact, true real complexes awaiting to be studied and characterized. </p>\n",

    "        references=[\"METHODS\\nConstruction of Plasmids\\nThe protein-coding regions of the NST3 gene were amplified from the Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library with appropriate primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The 5′ upstream region of 3027 bp, which extended from the site of initiation of translation of the NST3 gene, was used for preparation of the ProNST3:GUS, ProNST3:NST3, and ProNST3:NST3SRDX gene constructs. These genes and 35S:NST3 were constructed from modified vectors derived from pGreenII0029 (Hellens et al., 2000) and p35SSRDXG (Mitsuda et al., 2006). For complementation analysis, we used genomic fragments including NST1 (9580 bp) and NST3 (5199 bp), which contained 6523 and 3069 bp of the respective promoter regions. The region corresponding to the transgene of each vector, with the exception of the pGreen-based vectors, was transferred to the pBCKH plant expression vector (Mitsuda et al., 2006) using the Gateway system (Invitrogen).\\n\\nConditions for Plant Growth and Transformation\\nArabidopsis plants were grown in soil at 22°C with 16 h (long-day condition) or 8 h (short-day condition) of light daily. Unless otherwise stated, plants were grown under the long-day condition. For transformation, a T-DNA vector carrying the appropriate construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation, and the resultant Agrobacterium was infiltrated into Arabidopsis using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).\\n\\n\\nAssessment of the Mechanical Strength of Inflorescence Stems\\nWe used the bottom 5 cm of inflorescence stems taller than 25 cm for measurement of Young's modulus according to a previously described method (Kojima and Yamamoto, 2004).\\n\\nExamination of the Crystal State of Cellulose Microfibrils of Inflorescence Stems\\nThe bottom region of the inflorescence stems, as described above, was used for x-ray diffraction analysis according to a previously described method (Abe and Yamamoto, 2005). Nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (wavelength, 0.154 nm) at 30 kV and 35 mA was used with the reflection technique.\\n\\nIsolation of RNA, Microarray Experiments, and Analysis\\nTotal RNA was isolated with Trizol as described previously (Fukuda et al., 1991) from the bottom 4 cm of the inflorescence stems of three independent plants grown under the short-day condition and with a height of between 13 and 17 cm. Microarray analyses were performed with the Arabidopsis 2 Oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies). All microarray experiments and the analysis of data were performed as described previously (Mitsuda et al., 2005) with the exceptions summarized below. P values for differences between nst1-1 nst3-1 and wild-type plants were calculated by Welch's t test, based on a two-tailed distribution (n = 3). To minimize type-I family-wise errors in multiple and simultaneous statistical tests, we adopted a strategy for suppression of false positives. We calculated a Q-value to estimate the false discovery rate from the P value described above using QVALUE software (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) with the default setting. We considered genes with a Q-value of <0.1 to be genes expressed at different levels in nst1-1 nst3-1 and wild-type plants. Comprehensive gene group analysis using Fisher's exact test was performed with the R program package (http://www.r-project.org/). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (Mitsuda et al., 2005). For the analysis of NST transcripts in the mutant lines, RT-PCR was performed with appropriate primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online).\\n\\nLight and Fluorescence Microscopy\\nFor observations of lignin autofluorescence, we used a filter with the following specifications: glass, 365; dichroic mirror, 395; long-pass, 400. To observe ectopic secondary wall thickening, we cleared tissues by incubating them overnight in 70% lactic acid at 50°C. To prepare 70- to 150-μm sections of inflorescence stems and hypocotyls, we embedded the tissues in 3% agar then sectioned them on a vibrating microtome (HM-650V; Microm). Assays of GUS activity were performed with T1 or T2 transgenic plants. Plant tissues were fixed briefly, in some cases, in solution containing 0.3% formalin, 0.2% MES, pH 5.8, and 0.3 M mannitol before incubation in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide, and 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide at 37°C for up to 12 h. Stained stems and hypocotyls were embedded in 3% agar and sectioned. All observations by light and fluorescence microscopy were made with the Axioskop2 plus system (Carl Zeiss).\\n\\nUltrastructural Observation by Transmission Electron Microscopy\\nShort pieces of inflorescence stems were fixed in 30 mM HEPES buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde then fixed in HEPES buffer containing 2% osmium tetroxide. Fixed tissues were embedded in Q651 resin (Nissin EM). Sections of 80 to 90 nm thick were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed by a JEM1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.\\n\\nIdentification of NST Homologs in Poplar\\nPoplar NAC genes resembling the Arabidopsis NST genes were collected using the Advanced Search tool of the Joint Genome Initiative poplar database (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html) with the command, “find by homology to related protein with E-value <1.0e-20”; the database for Populus trichocarpa; and the query “At2g46770.” The 62 extracted sequences and amino acid sequences of subfamily IIb of NAC transcription factors of Arabidopsis, as defined in a previous study (Mitsuda et al., 2005), were aligned using the ClustalW program with default settings (Chenna et al., 2003). The amino acid sequences corresponding to conserved NAC domains were extracted and realigned. A phylogenetic tree was built by neighboring-joining method using ClustalW with default settings (an alignment and the sequences are shown in Supplemental Table 3 online). Bootstrap values were calculated from 100 trials. The subtree including the NST and VND genes is shown in Figure 7.\\n\\nAccession Numbers and Data Deposition\\nNST1 and NST3 reported in this study correspond to the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers At2g46770 and At1g32770, respectively. Microarray data performed in this study can be found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus data library under accession number GSE5187.\\n\"]\n",

We excluded chromosome 6 and 16 from analysis due to copy genomic aberrations present in the normal cell line HCC1395BL.\\n\\nCancer cell lines\\nIllumina HumanHap300 data for the promyelocytic leukemia cancer cell HL-60 and colon cancer cell line HT-29 were obtained from Illumina, and Human-610 Quad SNP genotyping data for the colon cancer cell lines SW403, SW480, SW620, SW837, SW1417 and LIM1863 were generated at the Ludwig Institute of Cancer Research using standard processing protocols. The genotyping data for breast cancer cell lines MDA-175 and MDA-468 were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus accession [GEO:GSE18799] [23].\\n\\nPrimary breast tumors\\nThree breast tumors (cases 114, 601 and 3,364) that had not received non-neoadjuvant therapy were analyzed in detail using material derived from microdissection. For each case, material containing pure tumor and pure stroma cells respectively was microdissected and compared to data obtained from surgically obtained material from the same tumors. Case 114 was of Luminal B type (23 mm tumor, moderately differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinoma with an extensive in-situ component. Node +ve, ER +ve (6.8 fm/mg protein), EGFR -ve (7.8 fm/mg protein)). Case 601 (20 mm 30 mm tumor, grade 3 with intraductal in-situ ca. and in filtrating ductal carcinoma, node +ve, ER -ve (1.5 fm/mg protein), Her2 +ve (histoscore of 3), EGFR +ve (histoscore of 208)) was classified as ERBB2 positive based on expression microarray data with a fractional rank of 0.982, Case 3,364 was 25 mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER positive (8 fm/mg protein), PR positive (histoscore 8/8), Her2 positive (histoscore 3+, one of ten axillary nodes +ve). For each case, DNA was extracted from microdissected stroma and tumor, as well as the original non-dissected sample and analyzed using Illumina Human-610 Quad SNP arrays applying standard protocols.\\n\\nData processing\\nGenome Alteration Print was downloaded [43] and used to analyze all datasets using default settings and the highest ranked copy number and LOH predictions used for comparisons.

Adjusted GenoCN parameters for the Log R Ratio levels were used for Infonaut HD SNP array processing and in these instances we used the same levels that we specified for OncoSNP. The copy number and LOH predictions from the Viterbi sequence were used for comparisons.\\n\\nOncoSNP was run on all datasets using 15 EM iterations and with both stromal and intra-tumor heterogeneity options. In all cases, the ploidy prediction with the highest maximum likelihood was chosen and the Viterbi sequence of tumor states used for comparisons. We filtered detected aberrations using a Log Bayes Factor of 30.\\n\\nStatistical model\\nA complete description of our statistical model is provided in Supplementary Information in Additional file 1.\\n\\nLet xi denote the tumor state at the i-th probe location and (xi, n, xi, t) denote the associated normal and tumor copy numbers.

Multiple restarts were used to explore different baseline of the Log R Ratio and the baseline with the greatest likelihood was chosen for the calculation of summary statistics.\\n\\nSummary statistics\\nWe used the Viterbi algorithm to extract the most likely sequence of tumors states and for each aberrant segment in the Viterbi sequence we calculated an approximate Bayes Factor (score) of that segment belonging to each of the tumor states. In addition we also recorded the maximum a posteriori estimates of the Log R Ratio baseline adjustment β0 and the stromal contamination π0.\\n\\nAvailability\\nA MATLAB based implementation (for 64 bit Linux systems) of our software is available for academic and non-commercial use from the associated website [45].
