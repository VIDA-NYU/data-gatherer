    "        references=[\"METHODS\\nConstruction of Plasmids\\nThe protein-coding regions of the NST3 gene were amplified from the Arabidopsis thaliana cDNA library with appropriate primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online). The 5′ upstream region of 3027 bp, which extended from the site of initiation of translation of the NST3 gene, was used for preparation of the ProNST3:GUS, ProNST3:NST3, and ProNST3:NST3SRDX gene constructs. These genes and 35S:NST3 were constructed from modified vectors derived from pGreenII0029 (Hellens et al., 2000) and p35SSRDXG (Mitsuda et al., 2006). For complementation analysis, we used genomic fragments including NST1 (9580 bp) and NST3 (5199 bp), which contained 6523 and 3069 bp of the respective promoter regions. The region corresponding to the transgene of each vector, with the exception of the pGreen-based vectors, was transferred to the pBCKH plant expression vector (Mitsuda et al., 2006) using the Gateway system (Invitrogen).\\n\\nConditions for Plant Growth and Transformation\\nArabidopsis plants were grown in soil at 22°C with 16 h (long-day condition) or 8 h (short-day condition) of light daily. Unless otherwise stated, plants were grown under the long-day condition. For transformation, a T-DNA vector carrying the appropriate construct was introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV3101 by electroporation, and the resultant Agrobacterium was infiltrated into Arabidopsis using the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998).\\n\\n\\nAssessment of the Mechanical Strength of Inflorescence Stems\\nWe used the bottom 5 cm of inflorescence stems taller than 25 cm for measurement of Young's modulus according to a previously described method (Kojima and Yamamoto, 2004).\\n\\nExamination of the Crystal State of Cellulose Microfibrils of Inflorescence Stems\\nThe bottom region of the inflorescence stems, as described above, was used for x-ray diffraction analysis according to a previously described method (Abe and Yamamoto, 2005). Nickel-filtered Cu Kα radiation (wavelength, 0.154 nm) at 30 kV and 35 mA was used with the reflection technique.\\n\\nIsolation of RNA, Microarray Experiments, and Analysis\\nTotal RNA was isolated with Trizol as described previously (Fukuda et al., 1991) from the bottom 4 cm of the inflorescence stems of three independent plants grown under the short-day condition and with a height of between 13 and 17 cm. Microarray analyses were performed with the Arabidopsis 2 Oligo Microarray (Agilent Technologies). All microarray experiments and the analysis of data were performed as described previously (Mitsuda et al., 2005) with the exceptions summarized below. P values for differences between nst1-1 nst3-1 and wild-type plants were calculated by Welch's t test, based on a two-tailed distribution (n = 3). To minimize type-I family-wise errors in multiple and simultaneous statistical tests, we adopted a strategy for suppression of false positives. We calculated a Q-value to estimate the false discovery rate from the P value described above using QVALUE software (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) with the default setting. We considered genes with a Q-value of <0.1 to be genes expressed at different levels in nst1-1 nst3-1 and wild-type plants. Comprehensive gene group analysis using Fisher's exact test was performed with the R program package (http://www.r-project.org/). Quantitative RT-PCR was performed as described previously (Mitsuda et al., 2005). For the analysis of NST transcripts in the mutant lines, RT-PCR was performed with appropriate primers (see Supplemental Table 2 online).\\n\\nLight and Fluorescence Microscopy\\nFor observations of lignin autofluorescence, we used a filter with the following specifications: glass, 365; dichroic mirror, 395; long-pass, 400. To observe ectopic secondary wall thickening, we cleared tissues by incubating them overnight in 70% lactic acid at 50°C. To prepare 70- to 150-μm sections of inflorescence stems and hypocotyls, we embedded the tissues in 3% agar then sectioned them on a vibrating microtome (HM-650V; Microm). Assays of GUS activity were performed with T1 or T2 transgenic plants. Plant tissues were fixed briefly, in some cases, in solution containing 0.3% formalin, 0.2% MES, pH 5.8, and 0.3 M mannitol before incubation in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-glucuronide, and 0.5 mM potassium ferricyanide at 37°C for up to 12 h. Stained stems and hypocotyls were embedded in 3% agar and sectioned. All observations by light and fluorescence microscopy were made with the Axioskop2 plus system (Carl Zeiss).\\n\\nUltrastructural Observation by Transmission Electron Microscopy\\nShort pieces of inflorescence stems were fixed in 30 mM HEPES buffer containing 2% paraformaldehyde and 2% glutaraldehyde then fixed in HEPES buffer containing 2% osmium tetroxide. Fixed tissues were embedded in Q651 resin (Nissin EM). Sections of 80 to 90 nm thick were post-stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed by a JEM1200EX transmission electron microscope (JEOL) at an accelerating voltage of 80 kV.\\n\\nIdentification of NST Homologs in Poplar\\nPoplar NAC genes resembling the Arabidopsis NST genes were collected using the Advanced Search tool of the Joint Genome Initiative poplar database (http://genome.jgi-psf.org/Poptr1/Poptr1.home.html) with the command, “find by homology to related protein with E-value <1.0e-20”; the database for Populus trichocarpa; and the query “At2g46770.” The 62 extracted sequences and amino acid sequences of subfamily IIb of NAC transcription factors of Arabidopsis, as defined in a previous study (Mitsuda et al., 2005), were aligned using the ClustalW program with default settings (Chenna et al., 2003). The amino acid sequences corresponding to conserved NAC domains were extracted and realigned. A phylogenetic tree was built by neighboring-joining method using ClustalW with default settings (an alignment and the sequences are shown in Supplemental Table 3 online). Bootstrap values were calculated from 100 trials. The subtree including the NST and VND genes is shown in Figure 7.\\n\\nAccession Numbers and Data Deposition\\nNST1 and NST3 reported in this study correspond to the Arabidopsis Genome Initiative locus identifiers At2g46770 and At1g32770, respectively. Microarray data performed in this study can be found in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gene Expression Omnibus data library under accession number GSE5187.\\n\"]\n",

The genotyping data for breast cancer cell lines MDA-175 and MDA-468 were downloaded from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus accession [GEO:GSE18799] [23].\\n\\nPrimary breast tumors\\nThree breast tumors (cases 114, 601 and 3,364) that had not received non-neoadjuvant therapy were analyzed in detail using material derived from microdissection. For each case, material containing pure tumor and pure stroma cells respectively was microdissected and compared to data obtained from surgically obtained material from the same tumors. Case 114 was of Luminal B type (23 mm tumor, moderately differentiated infiltrating ductal carcinoma with an extensive in-situ component. Node +ve, ER +ve (6.8 fm/mg protein), EGFR -ve (7.8 fm/mg protein)). Case 601 (20 mm 30 mm tumor, grade 3 with intraductal in-situ ca. and in filtrating ductal carcinoma, node +ve, ER -ve (1.5 fm/mg protein), Her2 +ve (histoscore of 3), EGFR +ve (histoscore of 208)) was classified as ERBB2 positive based on expression microarray data with a fractional rank of 0.982, Case 3,364 was 25 mm grade 3 infiltrating ductal carcinoma, ER positive (8 fm/mg protein), PR positive (histoscore 8/8), Her2 positive (histoscore 3+, one of ten axillary nodes +ve). For each case, DNA was extracted from microdissected stroma and tumor, as well as the original non-dissected sample and analyzed using Illumina Human-610 Quad SNP arrays applying standard protocols.\\n\\nData processing\\nGenome Alteration Print was downloaded [43] and used to analyze all datasets using default settings and the highest ranked copy number and LOH predictions used for comparisons.

Adjusted GenoCN parameters for the Log R Ratio levels were used for Infonaut HD SNP array processing and in these instances we used the same levels that we specified for OncoSNP. The copy number and LOH predictions from the Viterbi sequence were used for comparisons.\\n\\nOncoSNP was run on all datasets using 15 EM iterations and with both stromal and intra-tumor heterogeneity options. In all cases, the ploidy prediction with the highest maximum likelihood was chosen and the Viterbi sequence of tumor states used for comparisons.

Multiple restarts were used to explore different baseline of the Log R Ratio and the baseline with the greatest likelihood was chosen for the calculation of summary statistics.\\n\\nSummary statistics\\nWe used the Viterbi algorithm to extract the most likely sequence of tumors states and for each aberrant segment in the Viterbi sequence we calculated an approximate Bayes Factor (score) of that segment belonging to each of the tumor states.
