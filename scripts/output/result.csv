The figures illustrated the numbers of identified protein in each MS file ( Supplementary Fig. 1 A-B [this file] ). 
Among the top 10 significant DEPs, six were upregulated ( ), and four were downregulated ( ) (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). Additionally, 38 downregulated proteins were observed in NIFTP compared to non-NIFTP (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). Interestingly, only two downregulated proteins (TMCC1, ZN540) were found between WDT-UMP and non-WDT-UMP, a lower number than in other comparative analyses (Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, no discriminatory proteins were detected between NIFTP and WDT-UMP ( Supplementary Tables 5, 6 [this file] ). 
In conclusion, the hub genes encompassed and (Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ). 
Utilizing our molecular profile, we proposed a trajectory to recapitulate the progression sequence from NIFTP/WDT-UMP to IEFVPTC, demonstrating the potential for invasion ( Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ).",zip,Proteomics profile in encapsulated follicular patterned thyroid neoplasms,XML,,,,,,,

The relative abundances of BSA were compared among different groups of cell samples, and a small standard deviation suggests that the same protein in different groups was accurately quantified for a fair comparison ( Figure S1 [href=this file] ).
For drug-resistant cell lines, 72 and 46 proteins were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, in the H-Res group compared with the GH-Res group ( Figure S2D [href=this file] ). Comparative studies were also carried out between drug-resistant and drug-sensitive cells: the abundances of 255 proteins increased and 93 proteins decreased in the GH-Res group compared with the H group ( Figure S2B [href=this file] ).
The abundances of multiple P53 signaling pathway proteins (e.g., RRM2B, CYCS, SERPINB5, CDK1A, and CDK4) were significantly increased ( Figure S3 [href=this file] ) in drug-resistant cell lines (H-Res and GH-Res) compared with their control groups (H and GH), indicating a strong association of P53 signaling pathways ( Figure 2F [href=#F2] ) in the Iri resistance mechanisms.
GFP-labeled drug-sensitive cells (GH-DC) were isolated from the direct coculture system containing drug-resistant cells (H-Res) ( Figure S4A [href=this file] ) using FACS. The volcano plot illustrated 253 upregulated and 43 downregulated proteins in GH-DC cells compared to the control (GH) ( Figure S4B [href=this file] ).
Among them, ALDOA and ALDOC, which play significant roles in glycolysis and fructolysis steps for synthesis of ATP through TCA cycle, were upregulated in the HIF- 1 signaling pathway, resulting in a reduced oxygen consumption process ( Figures 3F [href=#F3] and S5 [href=this file] ).
As observed in the monoculture systems, the P53 signaling pathway and relevant proteins, including cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), and cytochrome c (CYCS), were significantly upregulated in drug-resistant cells ( Figures 2C [href=#F2] and 3S [href=this file] ).

Among the significantly positively enriched terms we identified, as expected from previous work, “helicase activity”, “RNA splicing”, “chromatin remodeling”, “histone binding” and “DNA repair” ( Figure 4C [rid=F4] ; Supplementary Table 7B [this file] ). 
We determined “mRNA binding”, “ATP hydrolysis activity”, “regulation of microtubule cytoskeleton organization”, “regulation of translation”, and “GTPase binding” to best portray these terms ( Figure 4D [rid=F4] ; Supplementary Table 7C [this file] ).

Figures S1–S6,local-data,mmc1,No description,Document  S1.  Figures  S1–S6,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"The most pronounced event we found was an enrichment of R>C substitutions in lung cancer patients (i.e., lung squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) and lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), Figures 1 [rid=fig1] A, 1B, and S1 [this file] A). No specific enrichment pattern of other arginine substitutions was observed in all other investigated tumor types ( Figure S1 [this file] B; Table S1 [rid=mmc3] ). To identify arginine substitutions, we used Philosopher, a “spectrum-centric” approach, [xref] [rid=bib22] which we validated with “a peptide-centric” approach using a universal targeted peptide search engine (PEPQUERY2). [xref] [rid=bib23] Here, too, we observed lung cancer-specific enrichment of R>C peptides even after stringent filtering ( Figures S1 [this file] C and S1D). 
The R>C peptides that were found only in LSCC and LUAD are further characterized by a low number of unique spectral assignment (peptide-spectral matches) ( Figure S1 [this file] E, = 2.2e ), suggesting that they are distinctive and specific to these tissues. This unique expression pattern of R>C peptides in LSCC and LUAD was not a result of their host gene expression, as determined by the analysis of the corresponding wild-type (R>C-WT) peptides containing arginine residues ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] E and S1 [this file] F). In this analysis, a fraction of the R>C-WT peptides could be tested due to the additional trypsin cleavage of arginine generating, on some occasions, too short peptides to be analyzed by mass spectrometry ( Figures S1 [this file] G and S1H). 
In comparison, no significant tumor enrichment was observed for control R>K and R>W peptides in LSCC and LUAD ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] B and S2 [this file] ), and no tumor enrichment was observed for R>C peptides in other tissues beyond LSCC and LUAD ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] A). 
When codon-specific arginine substitution libraries were examined (now containing 133 predicted mutated peptides) in the LSCC proteomic dataset, 4,900 R>C peptides were detected, of which only three emerged from genetic mutations (Tumor Protein P53 [TP53] , Laminin Subunit Alpha 2 [LAMA2] , and Histone Cluster 1 H4 Family Member E [H4C5] ; Figure S3 [this file] A; Table S2 [rid=mmc4] ). 
For these assays, we employed MDA-MB-231 cells, which are auxotrophic to arginine due to the low expression level of ASS1 ( Figure S3 [this file] B [xref] [rid=bib30] ). In line with the auxotrophic behavior of these cells, arginine depletion induced the inhibitory phosphorylation of the translational elongation factor eIF2A ( Figure S3 [this file] C). Similar results were obtained using the lung cancer cell line A549 ( Figures S3 [this file] D and S3E, = 0.001), which is in line with the identification of R>C in lung cancer proteomes ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] ). 
We found no significant difference in the total tRNA (CCG) in cells treated with arginine depletion supplemented with C2 or cysteine ( Figure S3 [this file] F). However, replacing C2 with cysteine augmented cysteine tRNA charging in arginine depletion conditions ( Figure S3 [this file] G) and, importantly, significantly increased Cys-index ∼10-fold (to ∼1, Figures 3 [rid=fig3] E and 3F, = 0.003). Although highly expressed ( Figure S3 [this file] H), no detectable cysteine incorporation to this protein was observed following arginine depletion, even when cells were cultured with cysteine in the medium ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] E and 3F, = 0.006). 
Indeed, the identified R>C peptides in LUAD and LSCC, as well as in the whole CPTAC cohort, showed an enrichment of CGU arginine codons and highlighted tRNA misalignment as the causal mechanism ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] B, S4 [this file] A, and S4B). By contrast, R>K substitutants, which were consistently present in the CPTAC dataset search ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] B and S1 [this file] C; Table S3 [rid=mmc5] ), showed a codon bias to AGA and AGG, which can be explained by misalignment of tRNA-Lys-UUU and tRNA-Lys-CUU to AGA and AGG codons of arginine, as was suggested before [xref] [rid=bib28] ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] B, S4 [this file] A, and S4B). This experiment validated the efficient induction of R>C substitutant reporter peptides following arginine depletion in the presence of cysteine ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] C, S4 [this file] C, and S4D). R>C incidents were also confirmed in two cell lines carrying a none-inducible KRT8s-V5 reporter vector, an experiment that identified additional arginine substitutant events (e.g., R>K, R>Q, and R>W, Figures S4 [this file] E and S4F). Although R>C showed restricted incorporation to CGC and CGU arginine codons, other events showed other preferences (e.g., R>H CGC and CGU, R>T AGG, R>S CGC, R>K to AGG, R>Q, and R>W to CGG; Figures S4 [this file] E and S4F). 
Immunoblot analysis validated the efficiency of RARS knockdowns ( Figure S4 [this file] G). 
Although efficient knockdowns were achieved, R>C substitutant levels were generally not reduced following arginine deprivation in the presence of cysteine ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] F and S4 [this file] G). 
Corresponding KEAP1 immunoblot is presented in Figure S5 [this file] C. 
We also attempted to explore gene-expression correlation in LUAD tumors but instead found a correlation to the nuclear factor kappa B subunit 1 (NFKB1) signaling pathway, which is known to regulate ferroptosis ( Figures S5 [this file] A and S5B [xref] [rid=bib36] ). 
Proteomics and immunoblot analyses confirmed the expression of KEAP1-WT ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] I, S5 [this file] C, and S5D). Further inspection of the proteomics also confirmed the downregulation of prime NRF2 targets (FTL, HMOX, and FTH1) and validated the restoration of the cellular response to oxidative stress in KEAP1-WT-expressing A549 cells ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] I and S5 [this file] E). 
Similar results were obtained with MDA-MB-231 cells, albeit up to 500 μM arginine ( Figure S5 [this file] F). 
Notably, metabolomic analysis of the cells at this point (3 days) validated arginine depletion and indicated an equilibrium between C2 and cysteine, with moderately more cysteine and C2 in the C2-treated condition ( Figure S6 [this file] A). We explain the increase in R>C by cysteine by higher tRNA charging ( Figure S3 [this file] G) at earlier time points following cysteine addition. Moreover, no difference was observed in the levels of glutathione (GSH and GSSH) in arginine-depleted cells supplemented with either C2 or cysteine ( Figure S6 [this file] A). This survival effect was despite the similar DNA damage levels caused by cisplatin, as measured by histone 2A.X variant γ (H2AX) nuclear intensity staining, and the similar levels of ferroptosis, as measured by 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein deacetate (DCFDA)-cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) assay ( Figures S6 [this file] B–S6E). Metabolomic analysis showed a similar profile as was observed in MDA-MB-231 ( Figure S6 [this file] A). Again, no significant differences were observed in the amount of DNA damage caused by cis-platin as measured by γH2AX nuclear intensity levels ( Figure S6 [this file] C). 
A reciprocal experiment is presented in Figure S6 [this file] D. 
This experiment revealed that only the combined treatment of arginine depletion with cysteine stimulated cell survival ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] D and S6 [this file] F, < 0.001). Cell cultures supplemented with either C2 or control tryptophan depletion, with either C2 or cysteine, showed no survival benefit, denying a key role for the general amino acid deprivation response and free cysteine supplementation in this phenotype ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] D and S6 [this file] F). 
Immunoblotting analysis verified similar expression of both reporter proteins ( Figure S6 [this file] G). We then first examined the impact of expressing these constructs on the active cysteine assay in cell lysates (see STAR Methods [rid=sec4] ) and observed a substantial average increase of ∼10% ( Figure S6 [this file] H). We observed this behavior regardless of the competing cells we used ( Figure S6 [this file] I, < 0.001). By contrast, KRT8s(10K)-V5-expressing cells did not show any significant growth advantage in any of the conditions ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] G and S6 [this file] F). 
In Figure S6 [this file] A, we observed that KEAP1-WT expression in KEAP1-mutant A549 cells increased intracellular C2 and cysteine levels. 
Density plots, as well as Barplots ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] C, 1F, S1 [this file] A, and S1B), were plotted for the number of peptide detections. For all substitution inter-tumoral and/or cross-substitutant enrichment analyses, a filter for the maximum number of samples (<25%) was applied to retain peptides with higher specificity in expression and to equalize the distribution of all substitutions ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] A, 1B, 2 [rid=fig2] A, 2B, 5 [rid=fig5] H, and S2 [this file] ). 
For the non-comparative single substitutant (R>C) based gene expression association study mentioned next, this filter was not applied to optimize signals and increase accountable data as previously described ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] B–5G, S5 [this file] A, and S5B).",pdf,Arginine deprivation enriches lung cancer proteomes with cysteine by inducing arginine-to-cysteine substitutants,XML,,,,,,,

The statistically significant univariate prognostic factors included age (log-rank test, = 0.035), gender (log-rank test, = 0.0085), and lymph node metastasis (LNM) (log-rank test, = 0.01) ( Figure S1 [this file] ). 
Of all cases, 11 were double-positive for ASCL1 and NeuroD1 ( Figure S2 [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ). 
The protein identities and relative abundances of each case, designated as fraction of total (FOT) [ 25 [rid=qzae033-B25] ], are provided in Table S2 [this file] . To develop a robust classification model, we first selected the top 1100 most abundant proteins detected from each sample, which yielded a dataset of 3460 proteins; then the 445 proteins that were detected in at least 8 samples (> 10%) with the coefficient of variation (CV) greater than 1.9 were used for non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) consensus clustering ( Table S3 [this file] ). S-III: hazard ratio (HR) = 4.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.81–12.4, Cox value = 0.002] after adjusting for TNM stage, VALG stage, and other covariates including chemotherapy, age, gender, LNM status, and smoking history ( Figure S3 [this file] ). 
The resulted 58 signature proteins [fold change (FC) > 1.5; adjusted -test, < 0.05] with high identification frequencies (detected in more than 25% of the samples) were used as input (predictor variables) ( Table S4 [this file] ). The corresponding clinical information of these samples is summarized in Table S5 [this file] . The results are listed in Table S6 [this file] . 
As a result, 206, 162, and 126 subtype-specific proteins for S-I, S-II, and S-III, respectively, were designated as significantly altered proteins ( [xref] [rid=qzae033-F3] ; Table S7 [this file] ). 
DNA repair and DNA replication proteins, including MSH3, LIG1, POLE3, RFC3, ORC2, and ATM, were also enriched ( Table S7 [this file] ). Manual inspection showed that proteins in chromatin organization/transcription regulation as well as various enzymes were enriched ( Table S7 [this file] ). 
Among these samples, 37 were treated with combined immunotherapy with chemotherapy as a first-line treatment, and 49 were from biopsy ( [xref] [rid=qzae033-F4] ; Table S8 [this file] ). We classified these samples using the model derived from the discovery dataset ( Table S9 [this file] ) into S-I (23 patients), S-II (13 patients), and S-III (16 patients). 
To develop a robust classification model, we first selected the top 1100 most abundant proteins detected from each sample, which yielded a dataset of 3460 proteins; then the 445 proteins that were detected in at least 8 samples (> 10%) with the CV greater than 1.9 were used for NMF consensus clustering ( Table S3 [this file] ).

Hierarchical clustering of compounds ( = 833) and their respective protein kinase targets ( = 226) revealed 5,341 nanomolar interactions illustrating that about half of the kinome can be drugged by the compound set analyzed here (Extended Data Fig. 3a [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
CATDS analysis showed that KCGS comprised the largest fraction of selective inhibitors (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] ) but still contained several broad-spectrum compounds including XMD-17-51 that bound to almost 50 proteins (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
According to previous Kinobeads profiling results, fostamatinib, its active metabolite and TAK659 bound many other proteins beside SYK (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] and published data and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ).

Assembling the Kinobeads data into a compound–target selectivity matrix revealed several clusters of selective inhibitors for a specific kinase (for example, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); Extended Data Fig. 4a [rid=Fig9] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
About 330 kinase inhibitors fulfilled these criteria and they target 72 kinases from all kinase subfamilies (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] , Extended Data Fig. 4b [rid=Fig9] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ).

The analysis covered a total of 21,400 phosphorylation sites (p sites, Extended Data Fig. 9c [rid=Fig14] and Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ) and showed that THZ1 and SB-476429-perturbed a large number of p sites, reflecting the engagement of many target kinases in cells.

We compared these to a heuristic-based approach of median imputation per feature across samples and 26 other approaches such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or random forest (RF) (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Samples were filtered in a second step by their completeness of the selected features (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
We applied the imputation methods to the development dataset, e.g. consisting of 564 samples for protein groups using our selection criteria (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
Additionally, the grid search results showed that the models could be trained without prior normalization and were able to fit the data using many different hyperparameter configurations (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). In summary, this indicated that on an unnormalized, intensity varying dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ) from a single machine the PIMMS models were able to capture patterns between detected features to impute values for as few as 50 samples with competitive performance to other state-of-the-art methods. 
We found similar results for the two other levels of data, aggregated peptides and precursors (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Accordingly, training models on randomly permuted data could not outperform the imputation by the median of the training data split with an MAE of 1.25 (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] , Supplementary Data 5 [rid=MOESM8] , CF: 1.24, VAE: 1.26, KNN_IMPUTE: 1,30 DAE: 1.32). The performance between fitted models varied in a narrow margin (protein groups: CF: 0.538-0.550, DAE: 0.535-0.545, VAE: 0.561-0.587 [Min-Max]) (Supplementary Figs. 5b,c [this file] , Supplementary Data 5 [rid=MOESM8] ). 
We evaluated performance without a specific distance measure by evaluating Pearson correlations of simulated missing values to the truth (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , Supplementary Data 6 [rid=MOESM9] ). 
This can be explained by the relatively stable measurements of the dataset (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ) and indicates that most protein groups were stable across patients. We found that VAE and TRKNN imputation techniques successfully recovered 15 out of the 17 protein groups that lost their differential abundance (DAE, RF: 14, CF: 13, Median, QRILC: 2) (Fig. 3c, e [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 9 [this file2] ). 
Then we investigated the number of differentially abundant protein groups as well as the ability of the plasma proteome to predict the fibrosis status of 358 individuals for the top five models, RSN, QRILC and median imputation (Supplementary Data 10 [this file3] ). However, the maximum intensity for missing values was higher for the VAE with a value of 21 compared to the RSN with a value of 15 for protein groups (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). This difference underlies a fundamental difference in the approaches and can be generalized for all other models (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). QRILC is a more nuanced MNAR method that does not only assign low intensities for missing values and we therefore added it to the comparison, although it shifts the distribution more strongly than RSN (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
Additionally, 13 were at least identified seven times as differentially abundant using DAE, TRKNN, CF, RF or VAE imputations (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] , Supplementary Data 13 [this file5] ). However, ten of these were only found using TRKNN imputations at least seven times (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
Using median imputation for all available protein groups yielded the best area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC) of 0.90 compared to 0.86–0.90 for DAE, TRKNN, CF, RF, QRILC and VAE on the test samples (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
We applied a two-step procedure for feature and sample selection (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ).

Therefore, in our default setup we sample 25 percent of the simulated missing values as MNAR into the validation and test data splits to represent the lower range of intensity values (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ), aiming to make the methods more comparable. 
The Pearson correlation was calculated for a feature across all predictions of all samples, denoted “per feature correlation”, or for all predictions within one sample, denoted “per sample correlation” (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Using a filtering of 25% for feature prevalence prior to imputation with the VAE (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ) we increased the share of missing values to 14% for the selected 377 protein groups in comparison to roughly 5% for the 313 features using the selection approach as in the original study . The q-values of each DA were then compared for the overlapping 313 protein groups (Supplementary Data 10 [this file3] – 12 [this file5] ).",pdf,Imputation of label-free quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics data using self-supervised deep learning,XML,,,,,,,

The histology of SCLC was confirmed in all cases; additional components of adenocarcinoma or large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) were identified in three patients (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). The clinical history was typical of SCLC and the majority of patients had received first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy, achieving a median relapse-free interval of 88 days (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] , Extended Data Table 1 [rid=Tab1] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). At relapse, 80% of these patients ( = 44 of 55) received additional lines of therapy, which included other chemotherapeutics or treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 ICIs (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
A detailed description of all clinical characteristics is provided in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] and Methods [rid=Sec9] . , Schematic overview showing the analysis of paired, patient-matched tumour sites: paired studies of spatially distinct tumours at the time of first diagnosis (treatment-naive, = 16); paired studies of tumour sites pretreatment and during treatment ( = 5) or at clinical relapse following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( = 42); paired analyses of spatially distinct tumour sites at relapse ( = 14); and analyses of tumours acquired before and after subsequent lines of treatment with ICIs ( = 7). 
We thus reconstructed the clonal lineage and determined tumour phylogenies for all 65 patients ( Supplementary Appendix [rid=Sec30] , Supplementary Tables 2 [this file] and 4 [this file] and Methods [rid=Sec9] ). 
The mutational patterns that underlie platinum damage have previously been identified both analytically and experimentally , and our own confidence in the respective assignments is based on both the large number of specimens (26%, = 12 of 46) and significant increase in platinum damage in tumours at relapse (** < 0.01; Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] , Extended Data Fig. 2d [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). 
Furthermore, similar to our observation in irradiated tumours, recurring tumour clones dominating at relapse following effective immunotherapy exhibited imprints of platinum-based DNA damage ( = 4 of five patients with stable disease and partial response; Fig. 3f,g [rid=Fig3] , Extended Data Fig. 2c [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). 
We also applied different approaches to identify significantly mutated genes with various levels of stringency and found that the core set of mutated genes was shared between other models and ours ( Methods [rid=Sec9] , Supplementary Tables 6 [this file] – 9 [this file] and Extended Data Figs. 4 [rid=Fig9] and 6 [rid=Fig11] ). 
We performed a combined analysis of this cohort and previously published datasets ( Methods [rid=Sec9] ), which showed significant mutations in ephrin-type B receptor 1 ( ) and neuronal cell-adhesion gene (Supplementary Table 8 [this file] and Extended Data Figs. 4a,e [rid=Fig9] and 6d,e [rid=Fig11] ). 
In the present study, too, cases with predominant expression of or showed a trend towards inferior relapse-free survival; however, sample size was small ( = 3) and correlations did not remain significant following correction for clinical parameters (Extended Data Fig. 7a–d [rid=Fig12] and Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ). 
We distinguished between missense mutations creating a full-length protein and other somatic alterations as probably ‘gene damaging’ due to either out-of-frame transcription, early termination or larger insertions or deletions impacting protein expression (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Table 11 [this file] and Methods [rid=Sec9] ). By contrast, damaging alterations constituted the vast majority of all lesions (95%; Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ) and no difference in response could be identified. In this cohort, too, damaging alterations of segregated with a short duration of relapse-free interval (Fig. 5b [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Table 12 [this file] ). 
The course of treatment for all patients and information on all samples are detailed below and summarized in Extended Data Table 1 [rid=Tab1] and Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] and 2 [this file] . 
All tumours were confirmed with SCLC histology; tumours from three patients were diagnosed with additional morphological components of LCNEC or adenocarcinoma (Extended Data Table 1 [rid=Tab1] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
In the majority of cases we analysed at least two tumour samples per patient, which were acquired at either single or multiple timepoints throughout the clinical course of treatment (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). For five patients we analysed tumour samples at three distinct time points ( = 5 of 65, 8%; Extended Data Table 1 [rid=Tab1] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). Samples analysed as PDX are listed in Supplementary Tables 2 [this file] and 3 [this file] and are highlighted in Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] . 
The clinical characteristics of the patients in our cohort are in line with those typically found in SCLC (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] , Extended Data Table 1 [rid=Tab1] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
The majority of the patients presented with a highly metastatic tumour classified as stages III and IV ( = 57 of 65, 88%; additional information on tumour, node and metastasis staging is provided in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Following treatment, two patients experienced fatal sepsis (patient S02608 while receiving treatment and experiencing disease progression; and patient S02658 following completion of chemotherapy; Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ); both patients were consequently censored when performing correlations with relapse-free survival, and the therapy response of patient S02608 was not evaluated. At relapse, 83% of patients ( = 44 of 53) received second-line systemic therapies that included treatment with anti-PD-1 and/or anti-CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitors ( = 27) or other chemotherapeutics, including topotecan ( = 8), rechallenge with carboplatin and etoposide ( = 2) or combinations of adriamycin, cyclophosphamide and vincristine ( = 7) (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
We thus performed in total = 84 paired analyses of tumour sites in 65 patients with SCLC (Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
In addition we performed clinical correlations in an independent cohort of patients with SCLC, who all received first-line systemic treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy; we performed whole-exome sequencing of the tumour samples and identified key genome alterations ( = 64 patients; Supplementary Table 12 [this file] ). 
Nucleic acids were extracted from fresh-frozen blood or tissue or from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue specimens (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Details on genome sequencing data and quality metrics are provided in Supplementary Table 3 [this file] . 
Median genome ploidy was determined at 2.5 (interquartile range 1.9–3.2; Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Paired-end sequencing at a minimum read length of 2× 150 bp was performed, and human DNA libraries were sequenced to an average coverage of 31× for both tumour and matched normal tissue (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Samples analysed by transcriptome sequencing are shown in Supplementary Table 2 [this file] . 
For genomic rearrangements determined by WGS in a subset of samples per patient (Supplementary Tables 2 [this file] and 3 [this file] ), PCR reactions were performed and the genomic breakpoint was probed and analysed in that subset of samples. 
Expression levels were determined for uniquely mapped paired-end reads using Cufflinks referring to the human reference genome, and expression levels were quantified as fragments per kilobase exon per million mapped reads (Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ). 
Our cohort additionally included patient tumours expanded in immune-compromised mice ( = 32 samples; Fig. 1a [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). The quality of the sequencing data is summarized in Supplementary Table 3 [this file] . 
Information on tumour phylogenies, subclonal mutations, subclones and clonal composition of sites is summarized in Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] and detailed information is provided in Supplementary Table 4 [this file] . 
The sequencing data of tumour samples in our cohort showed an average purity of 85% (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Additional information is provided in Supplementary Table 4 [this file] . 
Because we analysed various numbers of samples for each patient (in 37% of cases, more than two samples per patient) we additionally downscaled our analyses to only two samples per patient to permit interpatient comparisons (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] ); we thus performed a total of = 84 paired analyses (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
We first performed local remapping to the human genome for genomic rearrangements identified by our in-house pipeline and assigned CCFs for both chromosomal pairs of a given rearrangement with SVclone (Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ). 
The analysis of treatment-naive tumours refers to all naive samples available in this cohort ( = 58); signatures assigned to post-treatment tumours included all patients who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy ( = 45), and we further distinguished whether tumour sites were exposed to chemotherapy alone ( = 20) or were potentially exposed to additional ionizing radiation ( = 25; Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
Comparisons with CaMuS are provided in Extended Data Fig. 2h [rid=Fig7] and the data are summarized in Supplementary Table 5 [this file] . 
Samples pre- and post-treatment with ICI were analysed with the subset described above (Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). 
To assess the relevance of key gene alterations in our cohort we referred to our previous study of significant gene alterations determined for 110 human SCLC samples (Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ). We determined the mutational landscape for each patient by creating the union of all mutations identified in multiple samples—this refers to the sum of mutually inclusive and private events (Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ). All relevant and significant gene alterations are listed in Supplementary Table 8 [this file] . Comparison of these data is provided in Extended Data Fig. 4e [rid=Fig9] and Supplementary Table 8 [this file] . 
With regard to frequent alterations affecting , and (Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ), which also included larger genomic rearrangements of these genes (Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ), we further analysed the gene-damaging effect of alterations. The impact of any genome alterations was evaluated in combination with the transcriptome sequencing data of these tumours, thus further informing on the presumed damage to the gene transcript and resulting protein product (Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ). 
Significant copy number alterations are listed in Supplementary Table 9 [this file] . 
Overall genome ploidy was assigned for all patient tumours (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ), with a threshold of 2.8 or above set to define those with higher genome ploidy .

See also Figure S1 [href=this file] , Table S1 [href=#SD2] , and Data S1 [href=#SD5] and S2 [href=#SD6] .
Furthermore, using CIBERSORT deconvolution , we identified increased immune cell infiltration in the SCLC-P and SCLC-I subtypes, respectively ( Figure S1D [href=this file] .
The analysis highlighted profound differences in the global methylation level per subtype, with the SCLC-P subtype presenting with a hypomethylated phenotype and SCLC-N with a hypermethylated phenotype, while SCLC-A and SCLC-I were comparable in cohort 1 ( Figure 2A [href=#F2] ) as well as when filtering for tumor-intrinsic DNA methylation signals using the CAMDAC algorithm in a subset of samples in cohort 2 ( Figure S2A [href=this file] ; see STAR methods [href=#S12] ). The SCLC-P hypomethylation phenotype was also observed in cohort 2 while methylation patterns for the other subtypes appeared to differ between the cohorts ( Figure S2B [href=this file] ). Interestingly, in cell lines, SCLC-P was hypermethylated ( Figure S2C [href=this file] ) contrary to tumor methylation analysis, which was confirmed in two independent datasets of cell lines from the NCI SCLC cell miner project ( Figure S2D [href=this file] ) and the GDSC ( Figure S2E [href=this file] ), highlighting limitations when working with cell line derived tumor methylation data.
See also Figures S2 [href=this file] - 5 [href=this file] and Table S2 [href=#SD3] .
To further explore these subtype-specific differences in global methylation, we analyzed expression of 73 genes responsible for reading, writing, or erasing DNA and histone methylation and found 47 (64%) of them to be significantly differentially regulated across subtypes ( Table S2 [href=#SD3] ; Figure S3 [href=this file] ). Interestingly, the expression patterns of methylation effectors were distinct in SCLC cell line models, which might contribute to the discordance of global methylation patterns in cell lines compared to that in primary tumor samples ( Figure S4 [href=this file] ; Table S2 [href=#SD3] ).
We then highlight these highly associated sites according to their genomic location, for SCLC-A ( Figure 2I [href=#F2] ), SCLC-N ( Figure 2J [href=#F2] ), SCLC-P ( Figure 2K [href=#F2] ) and SCLC-I ( Figure 2L [href=#F2] ) as well as for each sample individually ( Figure S5 [href=this file] ).
We then selected the top DNA methylation sites for each of the four subtypes by differences in DNA methylation level and AUC, and created models that were trained by randomly selecting 10, 50, or 100 methylation sites per subtype, since this has been shown to provide sufficient information ( Figure S6A [href=this file] ). Furthermore, methylation sites selected are specific to SCLC compared to data obtained from lung adenocarcinoma and pre-neoplasia as well as non-cancer controls ( Figure S6B [href=this file] ) . We ultimately selected 50 methylation sites/subtype for our final predictive model, as this provided classification with high accuracy ( Figure S7A [href=this file] ). Interestingly, heterogeneity from the consensus approach was reduced in the DMC approach, compared to our GRC approach ( Figure S7B [href=this file] ; Figure 1D [href=#F1] ). In order to validate the performance of the assay and to ensure that tumor-intrinsic features have been used for the training, we used the DMC approach to also predict subtypes in a set of cell lines that had been classified previously ( Figure 7C [href=this file] ).
See also Figures S6 [href=this file] - 9 [href=this file] and Table S3 [href=#SD4] .
Indeed, we found multiple DNA methylation sites that correlate with ctDNA fraction based on ultra-low pass whole genome sequencing (ULP-WGS) and we selected seven methylation sites which are highly and linearly correlated to ctDNA fraction ( Figure S8A [href=this file] ).
We also compared the DNA methylation levels selected for the training with DNA methylation data obtained from healthy donors , and could demonstrate that baseline cfDNA samples from SCLC patients cluster generally distinctly to DNA methylation profiles from the healthy comparison ( Figure S8B [href=this file] ). Correlating global DNA methylation between healthy cfDNA and baseline samples, we observed a statistically significant drop in correlation for samples with higher ctDNA fraction (third and fourth quartile) compared to samples with lower ctDNA fraction (first and second quartile; Figure 8C [href=this file] ).
Our analysis of these samples demonstrated a strong heterogeneity in the sample subtype at progression as compared to their baseline classification ( Figure 3G [href=#F3] ; Figure 9A [href=this file] ). Indeed, in samples with subtype switching we saw marked differences in the promoter methylation of immune-related genes, such as , , as well as the interferon alpha and gamma receptors ( , , ) highlighting profound changes in the tumor:immune phenotypes ( Figure S9B [href=this file] ). Despite the switch to a more inflammatory phenotype, we did not detect any differences in PFS (HR = 0.49; 95% CI: 0.11 – 2.24) or OS (HR = 1.02; 95% CI: 0.27 – 3.9) for patients whose tumors switched to SCLC-I versus those that maintained SCLC-A subtype ( Figure S9C [href=this file] ). Treating SCLC cell lines with 2µM cisplatin for 9 days, did not alter DNA methylation in the respective genes, suggesting that the contribution of the tumor microenvironment might be required for subtype plasticity ( Figure S9D [href=this file] ).
We analyzed the accuracy for each of those models on the training and the testing set ( Figure S6A [href=this file] ).",pdf,Tumor- and circulating-free DNA methylation identifies clinically relevant small cell lung cancer subtypes - PMC,HTML,"(10.4MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/10982990/bin/NIHMS1974299-supplement-Supplementary.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

Using a consensus classification (see STAR methods [href=#S12] ) incorporating 181 genes, we were able to unambiguously classify the majority of samples into a single subtype, notably independent of the cohort and underlying RNA-seq method used ( Table S1 [href=this file] , Figure 1B [href=#F1] ). Across both cohorts, unambiguous subtyping was achieved for 136/142 (96%) of samples with RNA-seq data ( Table S1 [href=this file] ).
Due to some overlaps across the genes selected, finally 181 genes were used ( Table S1 [href=this file] ).

See also Figures S1 [href=this file] – S2 [href=this file] , and Table S1 [href=#SD2] .
All scRNA-seq data were merged, normalized, batch-corrected, and clustered to identify coarse cell types, including epithelial, mesenchymal, lymphoid, and myeloid cells ( Figures 1A [href=#F1] and S1B [href=this file] – C [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ).
MSK-IMPACT targeted sequencing ( Cheng et al., 2015 [href=#R18] ) of 14 SCLC samples demonstrated frequent mutation or loss of and , and recurrent mutations in and ( Figure S1D [href=this file] and S1E [href=this file] ). We detected higher CNV levels in SCLC than LUAD ( Figure S1F [href=this file] ), consistent with higher tumor mutation burden in SCLC ( Yarchoan et al., 2019 [href=#R103] ).
This observation is supported by the relative expression of canonical transcription factors ( Figure 1H [href=#F1] ), corresponding MYC family members ( Figure S1G [href=this file] ), and matched immunohistochemistry (IHC) when available ( Figure S1H [href=this file] ). We also identified intermediate cancer cells along the SCLC-A to SCLC-N spectrum, suggesting transitional or non-canonical phenotypes, as well as tumors of admixed subtype and a non-canonical SCLC phenotype with wild-type (see Figures S2A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] , Table S2 [href=#SD3] , and STAR Methods [href=#S14] for further details).
To better define the role of SCLC subtype in tumor progression, we assessed cell composition and gene expression differences across subtypes ( Figure S2C [href=this file] ). Consistent with mouse models ( Ireland et al., 2020 [href=#R46] ; Mollaoglu et al., 2017 [href=#R60] ), SCLC-A is significantly overrepresented in primary tumors, whereas SCLC-N is enriched in nodal and distant metastases (Dirichlet regression, p<3.4×10 ; Figure S2D [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ).
We performed differential expression (DE) and pathway analysis to determine subtype-specific gene programs ( Figures 2A [href=#F2] and S2E [href=this file] ; Tables S3 [href=#SD4] – 8 [href=this file0] ). We found that SCLC-A is enriched in expression of genes regulating cell cycle progression and DNA repair, as well as target genes implicated in SCLC cell cycle regulation ( Hubaux et al., 2013 [href=#R45] ; Poirier et al., 2015 [href=#R72] ) ( Figure S2E [href=this file] ). In contrast, SCLC-N tumors exhibit a pro-metastatic pattern of gene expression including overexpressed markers of (1) epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), ( Dongre and Weinberg, 2019a [href=#R23] ), (2) TGF-β( Farabaugh et al., 2012 [href=#R29] ), (3) BMP signaling ( Choi et al., 2019 [href=#R19] ; Dongre and Weinberg, 2019b [href=#R24] )( Bach et al., 2018 [href=#R5] ), (4) STAT ( Dongre and Weinberg, 2019b [href=#R24] ); and (5) TNFα-promoted NFκB signaling ( Jiang et al., 2001 [href=#R47] ; Wu and Zhou, 2010 [href=#R101] ) ( Figures 2A [href=#F2] , 2B [href=#F2] and S2E [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S2 [href=this file] and Table S1 [href=#SD2] .
Most clusters are specific to a single tumor, but cluster 22 is strikingly recurrent across samples (Mann-Whitney p < 2.2×10 ) ( Figures 3A [href=#F3] – C [href=#F3] and S3A [href=this file] ; Table S1 [href=#SD2] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ), spanning a range of treatment histories, tissue sites, and predominant subtypes ( Figure 3D [href=#F3] ). We confirmed that cells in the recurrent cluster have greater CNV burden than normal epithelial cells, consistent with a malignant phenotype ( Figure S3B [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S3 [href=this file] and Table S1 [href=#SD2] .
These cells are enriched in genes and gene programs related to metastasis and neural stem cells ( Figures 3E [href=#F3] and 3F [href=#F3] ; Table S9 [href=this file0] ). In microarray data from SCLC-A and SCLC-N cell lines in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database (N = 54), we confirmed that the gene signature for the recurrent cluster was significantly positively correlated with many of the same pathways associated with metastasis, chemotaxis, and stemness ( Figure S3C [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ).
Within Cluster 22, ( ) was the top differentially upregulated gene ( Figures 3F [href=#F3] and S3D [href=this file] ; Tables S10 [href=this file1] and S11 [href=this file2] ). has been previously implicated in Alzheimer’s disease ( Castillo et al., 2017 [href=#R15] ; van der Lee et al., 2019 [href=#R54] ) and its paralog promotes metastasis ( Kassis et al., 1999 [href=#R48] ; Sala et al., 2008 [href=#R80] ). We grouped results from knnDREMI into three gene modules corresponding to low (module 1), medium (module 2) and high expression (module 3) ( Figure S3E [href=this file] ; Table S12 [href=this file3] ). Among the top 5% of pathways most correlated to module 3 were those related to stemness (including and targets), metastatic gene signatures, and pro-metastatic signaling pathways (including Wnt and BMP signaling) ( Dongre and Weinberg, 2019b [href=#R24] ) ( Figures S3E [href=this file] and S3F [href=this file] ; Table S13 [href=this file4] ).
Exogenous PLCG2 overexpression did not affect proliferation (data not shown) but did increase anchorage-independent growth ( Figure S3G [href=this file] ). Western blot analyses validated key phenotypes observed in the single-cell data including (1) increased β-catenin expression, suggesting higher Wnt signaling, which was confirmed in a Wnt reporter assay ( Figure S3H [href=this file] ); (2) increased SMAD1/5 phosphorylation, consistent with higher BMP signaling; (3) increased expression of EMT/metastatic markers and (4) higher levels of stemness-related markers ( Figure 4D [href=#F4] ).
(J) Kaplan-Meier analysis of OS in patients with detectable PLCG2+ recurrent cluster cells by scRNA-seq (>0.75% vs ≤0.75% of SCLC cells) ( Table S16 [href=this file7] ). See also Figure S1 [href=this file] and Tables S1 [href=#SD2] , S14 [href=this file5] , and S16 [href=this file7] .
To determine the clinical significance of expression, we performed MIBI imaging on a tissue microarray (TMA) representing an independent cohort of SCLC tumor specimens (N = 37; Table S14 [href=this file5] ). We optimized cell-type-specific antibodies ( Table S15 [href=this file6] ) in combination with kernel density estimation of cells ( STAR Methods [href=#S14] ) to identify SCLC, immune, and stromal cell types ( Figure S4A [href=this file] ), which were consistent with IHC review of an adjacent TMA section by a pathologist (data not shown). An adjusted Cox proportional hazards model confirmed decreased overall survival (p = 0.041) and showed furthermore that high PLCG2 positivity is a stronger predictor of worse outcome than treatment history, presence of metastatic disease, or SCLC subtype ( Figure S4B [href=this file] ).
Patients for whom this subpopulation represents >0.75% of total cancer cells had significantly decreased overall survival relative to others (p = 0.008; Figure 4J [href=#F4] ; Table S16 [href=this file7] ). An adjusted Cox proportional hazards model confirmed worse overall survival and greater hazard ratio than positivity in the MIBI analysis (44.4 vs 5.47); positivity is a strong predictor, but less so than the full transcriptional phenotype of the recurrent cluster ( Figure S4C [href=this file] ).
Instead, we analyzed flow cytometry data from this cohort, as well as an independent SCLC cohort (N = 11, Table S17 [href=this file8] ). Focusing on SCLC-A and SCLC-N, we confirmed fewer CD45+ cells than LUAD, and found further reduction specifically in SCLC-N and NEUROD1-positive tumors ( Figures S4D [href=this file] and S4E [href=this file] ), consistent with prior bulk RNA-seq data suggesting that NEUROD1-positive tumors express lower levels of immune-related genes ( Best et al., 2020b [href=#R11] ).
Moreover, significantly more NEUROD1+ SCLC tumors are immune cold (univariate test - Fisher’s exact p = 0.0066; Figures 5A [href=#F5] , 5B [href=#F5] and S4F [href=this file] ). Upon adjusting for all clinical covariates, including tumor location, only NEUROD1 positivity is a significant predictor of immune-cold status (Student’s t-test p = 0.037; Figure S4G [href=this file] ).
See also Figures S4 [href=this file] – S5 [href=this file] and Tables S14 [href=this file5] , S17 [href=this file8] , and S18 [href=this file9] .
We found that the distribution of the immune-tumor mixing score among immune-hot SCLC tumors (N = 13) was significantly lower than in immune-hot TNBC tumors (N = 34) (Welch’s t-test p = 0.026; Figures 5A [href=#F5] , 5C [href=#F5] and S4F [href=this file] ).
To this end, we pooled immune cells across the 21 SCLC samples in our cohort (N = 16,475 cells), using immune cells from LUAD (N = 45,535 cells) and normal adjacent lung (N = 10,934 cells) as a reference ( Figure S5A [href=this file] ). We analyzed the myeloid and T-cell compartments separately to facilitate cell type annotation ( Figures 5D [href=#F5] , S5A [href=this file] – E [href=this file] , S6C [href=this file] – F [href=this file] and S7C [href=this file] ; Table S18 [href=this file9] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ). Our cohort is well-balanced with respect to treatment history (7 untreated, 6 treated with chemotherapy and 8 with chemotherapy and immunotherapy) ( Figure S1A [href=this file] ).
To assess how SCLC subtype impacts T-cell phenotype, we applied non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) ( Chung et al., 2017 [href=#R20] ; Puram et al., 2017 [href=#R74] ; Stein-O’Brien et al., 2018 [href=#R90] ), which excels in settings of continuous phenotypes with uncertain cluster boundaries, and identified 30 factors that facilitate cell-type annotation ( Figures S6A [href=this file] and S6B [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ). Of these factors, 7 correspond to T-cell phenotypes: CD4+ regulatory (Tregs, factor 4), CD4+ conventional (Tconv, factors 19 and 23), CD8+ exhausted (Texh, factor 7), CD8+ memory (Tmem, factor 12), CD8+ effector (Teff, factor 28), and CD8+ gamma delta T-cells (Tgd, factor 29) ( Figure S6C [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ). A parallel cluster-based phenotyping approach confirmed the annotation of discrete T-cell phenotypes ( Figures S6D [href=this file] – F [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ). SCLC-N exhibits significantly higher Treg factor 4 and CD8+ exhausted factor 7, as well as significantly lower CD8+ effector-like factor 28 and Tgd factor 29 compared with SCLC-A ( Figure S6G [href=this file] ). The ratio of CD8+ effector to Treg factor loadings is significantly lower in SCLC-N than SCLC-A (p = 0.001; Figure 5E [href=#F5] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ) and is robust to the number of factors ( Figure S6H [href=this file] ). This measure of immunosuppression is consistent with a parallel cluster-based CD8+ effector/Treg ratio (p = 0.001; Figure S6I [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ).
To examine the myeloid compartment, we reclustered these cells from SCLC samples in our scRNA-seq dataset (N = 2,951 cells), resulting in 7 monocyte/macrophage (Mono/Mφ), 4 neutrophil, and 2 dendritic clusters ( Figure 6A [href=#F6] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ; see Figures S7A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] for mapping to the combined SCLC, LUAD, and normal lung myeloid dataset). SCLC myeloid clusters 1, 7, 9, and 12 represent a subset of Mono/Mφ cells that overexpress genes related to the extracellular matrix (ECM), including and ( Figures 6A [href=#F6] and S7C [href=this file] ; Table S19 [href=#SD20] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ).
See also Figures S6 [href=this file] – S7 [href=this file] and Tables S18 [href=this file9] – S19 [href=#SD20] .
Unsupervised clustering of the combined myeloid compartment of SCLC, LUAD, and normal lung identified a single cluster (‘combined cluster 6’), which is comprised of Mono/Mφ from SCLC clusters 1 and 7 (N = 514 cells from 14 SCLC samples) and from LUAD samples (N = 467 cells from 6 LUAD samples), but none from normal lung ( Figures S7A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] ).
Differential expression ( Figure S7D [href=this file] ; Table S19 [href=#SD20] ) identified cluster 1 as a + + + subpopulation that secretes specific pro-fibrotic, pro-metastatic growth factors involved in ECM deposition and remodeling( Winkler et al., 2020 [href=#R99] ), including fibronectin 1 ( ) ( Park and Helfman, 2019 [href=#R68] ; Wang and Hielscher, 2017 [href=#R98] ), cathepsins ( and ) ( Egeblad and Werb, 2002 [href=#R27] ; Guo et al., 2002 [href=#R40] ), and osteopontin ( ) ( Giopanou et al., 2017 [href=#R38] ; Pang et al., 2019 [href=#R67] ).
Separately, we found that Mono/Mφ cluster 1 is enriched in samples harboring the recurrent SCLC cluster and that this enrichment is robust to sampling (p = 0.018; Figure S7E [href=this file] and S7F [href=this file] ; STAR Methods [href=#S14] ). We also confirmed that the profibrotic Mono/Mφ population is significantly correlated with and EMT gene signatures in independent bulk RNA-seq datasets (N = 81; Figure S7G [href=this file] ) ( George et al., 2015 [href=#R37] ; Rudin et al., 2012 [href=#R77] ).
We confirmed significant correlation of CD8+ T-cell exhaustion to profibrotic Mono/Mφ and in published bulk RNA-seq datasets (N = 81; Figure S7G [href=this file] ).
We see a similar association of NEUROD1+ SCLC cells with PLCG2 positivity and profibrotic Mono/Mφ in patient MIBI 3 ( Figures S7H [href=this file] and S7I [href=this file] ).
Pre-processing steps of scRNA-seq are illustrated in Figure S1C [href=this file] and detailed as follows.
This sample entropy was projected on the UMAP ( Figure S1B [href=this file] ).
Given the sparse nature of scRNA-seq that arises from gene dropout, we used gene imputation using MAGIC (knn = 30, t=3)( Dijk et al., 2018 [href=#R22] ) when performing knnDREMI calculations (described in section “ Identifying the PLCG2-related gene module [href=#S76] ”) and for visualizing gene expression on both UMAPs and heatmaps ( Figures 1G [href=#F1] , S1G [href=this file] , S2B [href=this file] , S2C [href=this file] , S3E [href=this file] ).
To visualize single cells of the global atlas as well as epithelial, SCLC, immune, T-cell, and myeloid subsets, we used UMAP projections( McInnes et al., 2018 [href=#R59] ) to generate lower dimensional representations using knn = 15, min_dist = 0.3–0.5, and init_pos = ‘paga’ ( Figure 1A [href=#F1] – C [href=#F1] , 1G [href=#F1] – H [href=#F1] , 3C [href=#F3] , 5D [href=#F5] , 6A [href=#F6] , 6C [href=#F6] , S1B [href=this file] , S1G [href=this file] , S2B [href=this file] , S3A [href=this file] , S5A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] , S7A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] ).
We subsetted the data based on these coarse cell types for downstream analysis ( Figure S1C [href=this file] ).
We noted that CNV burden was higher in SCLC tumors compared to LUAD ( Figures S1F [href=this file] ), consistent with SCLC having a higher tumor mutation burden ( Yarchoan et al., 2019 [href=#R103] ).
Cell type labels were smoothed by cluster after manual inspection to ensure accurate separation of cells ( Figure S5D [href=this file] ).
We used non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) implemented in scikit-learn (version 20.0) with default parameters except for tolerance for stopping condition 10 , maximum number of iterations 500, and number of factors = 30, as selected by calculating the kneepoint of the log2 reconstruction error over the number of factors ( Figure S6A [href=this file] ). We ensured that NMF factors were robust over a range of k=24–36 based on correlation ( Figure S6B [href=this file] , described in section “ Robustness analysis of clustering and factor analysis [href=#S65] ”).
We then performed differential expression between each cluster and the rest (described in section “ Differential expression of tumor and immune subsets in scRNA-seq [href=#S52] ”) and compared DEGs to curated markers of T-cell phenotype ( Data S2 [href=#SD27] ) ( Figure S6C [href=this file] – D [href=this file] ). Finally, we confirmed agreement of our cluster-based cell typing with NMF factors, by calculating the mean cell loadings of each T-cell annotated factor within each cluster-based cell type ( Figure S6E [href=this file] ).
We show select DEGs that characterize each of the myeloid clusters in Figure S7C [href=this file] .
We performed NMF over a range of k number of components from 5 to 100 and selected k=30 based on the kneepoint of the reconstruction error, defined as the Frobenius norm of the matrix difference between the observed gene expression matrix and the reconstructed matrix ( Figure S6A [href=this file] ). We ensured the robustness of our NMF factors to the choice of k by generating NMF factors over a range of k = 24–36 and computing the Pearson’s correlation between the cell loadings of each factor with those obtained using k=30 ( Figure S6B [href=this file] ).
The vast majority of tumors were predominantly composed of a single SCLC subtype ( Figure S2A [href=this file] ).
One sample (Ru1215) harbored two discrete SCLC-A and SCLC-N subpopulations within the same tumor ( Figure S2B [href=this file] ).
We then performed pathway analysis using GSEA to determine subtype-specific gene programs ( Figures 2A [href=#F2] and S2E [href=this file] ; and Tables S7 [href=#SD8] – 8 [href=#SD9] ). To visualize the gene signatures characterizing each subtype, we plotted the heatmap, following hierarchical clustering of imputed gene expression ( Figure S2C [href=this file] ).
We found that SCLC-A is enriched in expression of genes regulating cell cycle progression and DNA repair, as well as target genes implicated in SCLC cell cycle regulation( Hubaux et al., 2013 [href=#R45] ; Poirier et al., 2015 [href=#R72] ) ( Figure S2E [href=this file] ). In contrast, SCLC-N tumors exhibit a pro-metastatic pattern of gene expression including overexpressed markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) ( and )( Dongre and Weinberg, 2019a [href=#R23] ) and hypoxia and angiogenesis ( or ) ( Figures 2A [href=#F2] , 2B [href=#F2] and S2E [href=this file] ). SCLC-N also overexpressed metastasis-related signaling pathways, including (1) TGF-β ( Farabaugh et al., 2012 [href=#R29] ) (upregulation of and ); (2) BMP signaling ( Choi et al., 2019 [href=#R19] ; Dongre and Weinberg, 2019b [href=#R24] ) (upregulation of ligands and receptors ) ( Bach et al., 2018 [href=#R5] ); (3) STAT signaling (upregulation of , , ) ( Dongre and Weinberg, 2019b [href=#R24] ); and (4) TNFα-promoted NFκB signaling (upregulation of ) ( Jiang et al., 2001 [href=#R47] ; Wu and Zhou, 2010 [href=#R101] ) ( Figures 2A [href=#F2] , 2B [href=#F2] and S2E [href=this file] ).
We used several approaches to compare the fraction of cancer cells of different SCLC subtypes in primary lung vs lymph node vs distant metastasis ( Figure S2D [href=this file] ).
We plotted the z-scored expression of the genes with the highest knnDREMI on a heatmap, ordering columns by expression (top row) ( Figure S3E [href=this file] ). We then performed hierarchical clustering to find three gene modules corresponding to low, intermediate, and high ( Table S12 [href=this file3] ).
We considered pathways among the top 5% correlated, corresponding to a minimum correlation threshold of ρ = 0.341 ( Figure S3F [href=this file] , Table S13 [href=this file4] ).
Interestingly, sample Ru1108 had a strong subtype probability for SCLC-A but was transcriptionally distinct from the rest of the SCLC-A group ( Figure 1G [href=#F1] , S2C [href=this file] ).
Three patients were treated with later-line chemotherapies including temozolomide ( Figure S1A [href=this file] and Table S1 [href=#SD2] ).
We then performed a Bonferroni-adjusted two-sample t-test on the residuals of the factor loadings ( Figure S6G [href=this file] ).
To ensure the results are not driven by the choice of k for NMF, we also verified that the result remains significant over a range of k=24–36 ( Figure S6H [href=this file] ).
Differential expression using MAST (see “ Differential expression of tumor and immune subsets in scRNA-seq [href=#S52] ”) ( Figures S7D [href=this file] ) identifies cluster 1 as a + + + subpopulation.
We show the relative frequency of each cell type per sample in Figure S4A [href=this file] .

Similar to other single-cell studies in lung( Travaglini et al., 2019 [href=#R96] ), we annotated clusters by coarse cell type based on expression of tissue compartment markers (for example, for immune cells, for epithelial cells, for fibroblasts, and for endothelial cells) ( Figure 1A [href=#F1] , Data S2 [href=this file] ).
We considered a cell cluster to be neuroendocrine based on expression of canonical markers ( , , , , also see Data S2 [href=this file] ).
We then curated multiple recent publications for specific canonical markers for a range of cell types, including epithelial lineages in the lung ( Laughney et al., 2020 [href=#R53] ; Montoro et al., 2018 [href=#R61] ; Travaglini et al., 2019 [href=#R96] ), and liver ( Aizarani et al., 2019 [href=#R2] ) (see Data S2 [href=this file] ).
Using Phenograph with k = 30 nearest neighbors, we identified 21 clusters, annotated as B/plasma, T, Myeloid and NK cells using marker genes curated from multiple publications for canonical markers for major immune cell types (including ; also see Data S2 [href=this file] ).
By comparing to a reference set of gene markers ( Data S2 [href=this file] ), we annotated 7 factors with T-cell phenotypes (2 Tconv, 1 Treg, 1 effector-like, 1 memory-like, 1 exhausted, and 1 Tgd factor).
We then performed differential expression between each cluster and the rest (described in section “ Differential expression of tumor and immune subsets in scRNA-seq [href=#S52] ”) and compared DEGs to curated markers of T-cell phenotype ( Data S2 [href=this file] ) ( Figure S6C [href=#SD1] – D [href=#SD1] ). Having successfully identified T-cell subsets at the combined level, we confirmed that these annotations restricted to SCLC were also consistent with known gene markers ( Data S2 [href=this file] ).

We observed a spectrum of response; 2/10 models achieved complete responses, while 8/10 showed a broad index of partial responses, ranging from 65% to 95% tumor growth inhibition, without any dose-limiting toxicity as measured by animal weights ( Figures 1B [href=#F1] , S1A–S1C [href=this file] ). This was not due to a change in the time to randomization of these models ( Figure 1F [href=#F1] ) or increased mitotic index as measured by Ki67 staining ( Figure 1G [href=#F1] ), but rather it reflects the ability of the chemoresistant derivative tumors to grow through the selective pressure ( Figures 1C [href=#F1] and S1 [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S1 and Table S1 [href=this file] .
We first confirmed by examining more than 1,000 common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that the resistant models were derived from the parental models and did not arise from cross-contamination with other cell lines, PDX, or spontaneous murine malignancies ( Figure S2A [href=this file] ). In all cases, >90% of bases could be called based on a read depth of ≥15 ( Figure S2B [href=this file] ). However, we were not able to identify recurrent acquired mutations across independent tumor models; no putative causal mutations of acquired resistance were found ( Figure S2C [href=this file] ), leading us to conclude that private mutations in the chemoresistant setting are passengers, not direct drivers of chemoresistance.
See also Figure S2 [href=this file] .
Principal component analysis suggested that gene expression patterns were remarkably consistent between chemonaive and chemoresistant settings and could easily discriminate between PDX models ( Figures 3A [href=#F3] and S3A [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S3 [href=this file] .
Robust in vitro acquired resistance to etoposide was associated with a change in phenotype, converting from a suspension, spheroid culture to an exclusively adherent culture ( Figure S3B [href=this file] ). Again, the schedule of C/E was well-tolerated based on animals weights and provided significant tumor growth control in the naive, but not resistant allograft (p=0.0026, Figure S3C [href=this file] ). Principal component and differential gene expression analysis suggested EMT-like changes in all three models tested, with the first principal component strongly separating parental and resistant versions of the models ( Figures S3D–S3F [href=this file] ).
Notably, conditional gain of WT or K145E DNA-binding mutant ( Maia et al., 2012 [href=#R20] ) did not robustly change the sensitivity to etoposide, in contrast to the shift we observed ex vivo between naive and resistant allograft lines (IC naive TKO-A ∼0.15 µM, versus IC resistant TKO-AR ∼3.0 µM; Figure S3G [href=this file] ). Moreover, conditional suppression of / by shRNA could neither rescue chemosensitivity in mouse or TWIST1 human SCLC cell lines nor influence other features of EMT observed in the resistant mSCLC cell lines, such as downregulation of E-cadherin ( Figures S3G–S3I [href=this file] ).
In 2 models where chemoresistance was associated with a substantial decrease in SLFN11 ( Figure 4F [href=#F4] ), we confirmed quantitative decreases in SLFN11 expression at both the transcript level by RNA-seq and protein level by quantitative Western blotting ( Figures 4G [href=#F4] and S4A–S4C [href=this file] ). Interestingly, an endpoint analysis of vehicle and C/E treatment groups from chemonaive and chemoresistant cohorts in one model revealed a significant decrease in SLFN11 in progressing tumors (p=0.029; Figure S4D [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S4 [href=this file] .
However, applying a dichotomized H-score of 68.8 using Youden’s index ( Youden, 1950 [href=#R41] ) did not show a statistically significant difference in overall survival (p=0.884, Log-rank test; Figure S4E [href=this file] ).
Re-expression of SLFN11 was dose-dependent and stable under acute DNA damage ( Figure S5A [href=this file] ). The extent to which SLFN11 protein levels were increased by EPZ was strongly correlated to an increase in topotecan sensitivity across all cell lines tested (Pearson r=0.916; Figures 5F [href=#F5] and S5B [href=this file] ). SLFN11 protein re-expression by EPZ was suppressible with shRNAs targeting ( Figure S5C and S5D [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S5 [href=this file] .
Consistent with this observation, shRNA-mediated suppression of in NCI-H526, a cell line with high baseline SLFN11 expression, modestly decreased sensitivity of this line to topotecan, although we note that complete suppression of SLFN11 was not possible even with a potent shRNA ( Figure S5E [href=this file] ).
We examined the efficacy of EPZ in 4 PDX models at two dose schedules over a treatment period of 3 weeks ( Table S2 [href=this file] ). This schedule slowed tumor growth modestly in 3 of 4 models tested ( Figure S6A [href=this file] ), and EPZ was well tolerated in animals based on weight measurements when administered at 250 mg/kg orally, twice a day (PO bid) ( Figure S6B [href=this file] ). This analysis included a chemorefractory model, JHU-LX44, that was omitted from the analysis of chemosensitive models ( Figure S6C [href=this file] ). We further assessed the contribution of time-dependence for efficacy in vivo by re-engrafting equivalent viable cell numbers from tumors that had previously been treated for 21 days with or without EPZ and then re-treating tumors with vehicle or a secondary round of EPZ as soon as tumors became palpable ( Figure S6D [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S6 and Table S2 [href=this file] .
Coordinate with the increase in H3K27me3 across the gene body in the chemoresistant versions, there is almost complete loss of H3K27Ac, a mark associated with transcriptionally active chromatin, at the TSS of , which we confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (p<0.0001; Figure S6E [href=this file] ). We further confirmed gene body erasure of H3K27me3 within exons 2–7 of by exon-by-exon ChIP-qPCR ( Figure S6F [href=this file] ). While we observed rescue of in PDX models that downregulated the gene upon acquiring resistance to C/E, expression was not rescued in models that expressed low to undetectable levels of at baseline ( Figure S6G [href=this file] ).
The effect of DNA damage increasing global H3K27me3 levels was not cell line specific ( Figure S7A [href=this file] ), demonstrated dose-dependence ( Figure S7B [href=this file] ), and was more pronounced for topotecan when compared to either cisplatin or etoposide on an equimolar basis ( Figure S7C [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S7 [href=this file] and Table S3 [href=#SD2] .
Addition of EPZ to 6 cycles of C/E strongly enhanced disease control in the chemonaive setting in both JHU-LX102 and SCRX-Lu149 relative to either EPZ or C/E alone without increasing animal weight loss ( Figures 7D, 7E [href=#F7] , S7D and S7E [href=this file] ).
Importantly, we observed strong cross-resistance to IRI, but not ionizing radiation, in the chemoresistant setting, further supporting the mechanism of acquired resistance operant in these models had specificity to the selection agents used (cisplatin and/or etoposide) ( Figures S7F and S7G [href=this file] ). The addition of EPZ to IRI in the chemoresistant setting resulted in potent combinatorial activity that could control disease to a greater extent than either agent alone through 6 weekly cycles of treatment without increasing animal weight loss ( Figures 7F, 7G [href=#F7] , S7H and S7I [href=this file] ).
When comparing the responses of a SLFN11 to a SLFN11 model, both chemonaive models displayed sensitivity to IRI, but only in the SLFN11 model is the combined activity of EPZ and IRI strikingly different ( Figures S7J and S7K [href=this file] ). Moreover, while all SLFN11 JHU-LX102 tumors in the combination arm were ablated after 6 cycles, tumors eventually recurred yet still maintained comparable sensitivity to the combination ( Figure S7K [href=this file] ). Recurrent tumors appeared similar to untreated tumors, not displaying differentiation away from their proliferative, neuroendocrine features ( Figures S7L [href=this file] ). Body weight and repeat blood chemistry monitoring during 2 weeks of treatment revealed no significant toxicity of the combination as compared to single agents ( Figure S7M [href=this file] and Table S3 [href=#SD2] ). Further, gross necropsy also suggested no apparent major organ toxicities ( Figure S7N [href=this file] ).

A comparison of the mutation patterns between relapse and treatment-naive samples by deconstructSigs failed to show an enrichment for the pancreatic platinum-response-associated mutation signature in relapse samples (signature 3, Supplementary fig. 1 [this file] ), possibly owing to the similarity in context between smoking and platinum-associated mutation signatures , and to the overwhelming proportion of smoking-associated mutations across our samples. For two individuals, metastatic sites were sectioned and sequenced, indicating little spatial heterogeneity in mutations within a metastatic site; however, distinct subsets of mutations were identified in samples collected from different metastatic sites within the same patient (Supplementary fig. 2 [this file] ). 
Including and , a total of 30 genes were mutated at a statistically significant level using MuSiC (FDR CT, < 0.1) when evaluating only relapse SCLC samples (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] ) . ( = 8.06e−07, Supplementary table 3 [this file] ), which codes for the alpha I chain of type XI collagen, was the most significantly mutated gene (SMG) after and . 
We also observed multiple recurrent somatic copy number alterations in relapsed SCLCs by GISTIC analysis ( < 0.1) (Supplementary table 4 [this file] ) , some of which are likely to play a crucial role in mediating chemotherapy resistance. 
From these 882 genes, 603 were altered in relapse samples and none of the treatment-naive samples (Supplementary table 5 [this file] ). For this purpose, we utilized a list of 114 genes that were mutated at a statistically significant level across 21 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer analysis (Supplementary table 6 [this file] ) . 
Contrary to what has been observed in treatment-naive SCLCs, we observed deletions encompassing ( = 4) at a statistically significant level in relapsed SCLC samples ( < 0.1; Supplementary table 4 [this file] ). 
Evaluating our previously identified relapse-acquired genes, we observed that mutations in and were both mutually exclusive and present in nearly one third of relapse SCLC samples ( = 4, 6, respectively; Supplementary fig. 3 [this file] ). , which is mutated in several cancers, is a well-established negative regulator of CTNNB1 (β-catenin) and WNT signaling . To evaluate this, we examined our data for mutations in other genes of the CTNNB1-mediated (canonical) WNT signaling pathway (Online Methods; Supplementary table 7 [this file] ). This analysis revealed relapse-acquired mutations in additional genes regulating canonical WNT signaling such as , , , , , , and (Supplementary fig. 3 [this file] ). 
Stable APC knockdown through lentiviral delivery of short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) in the NCI-H1694 cell line (chemotherapy sensitive with wildtype ), led to the activation of canonical WNT signaling and made these cells highly resistant to etoposide (Fig. 4a–c [rid=Fig4] ) and—to a lesser degree—cisplatin (Supplementary fig. 4a, b [this file] ). Additionally, these cells could be re-sensitized to chemotherapy following overexpression of a wildtype APC construct lacking untranslated regions (UTRs), in cells stably transfected with a knockdown shRNA construct targeting the 3′ UTR (construct shAPC#2; Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary fig. 4c [this file] ). Chemotherapy resistant variants of both cell lines showed evidence of increased WNT activity when compared to their chemotherapy sensitive counterparts based on increased levels of CTNNB1 and TCF/LEF (TOPFlash) WNT reporter activity (Supplementary fig. 5 [this file] ). 
Pathological diagnosis was confirmed by independent review by two pathologists (authors CJO and JHR; images available as Supplementary Data [this file] ).

The union of snv/indel variant calls for each sample were manually reviewed using IGV (Supplementary table 10 [this file] ). 
A difference of indel counts between limited and extensive stage samples (Supplementary table 1 [this file] ) was tested by unpaired test. 
A zygosity score above 30 (representing an average tumor VAF < 20 or >80) was used to call a gene as loss-of-heterozygosity (LoH) (Supplementary table 11 [this file] ). 
Cancer relevant genes were collected from Supplementary table 2 [this file] of Lawrence et al., and filtered for a pan-cancer value < = 0.1, as discussed in the main text of that paper (list of genes available in Supplementary table 6 [this file] ). A list of genes participating in canonical WNT signaling was curated from Reactome (Supplementary table 7 [this file] ) after analyzing WNT gene lists R-HSA195721 (Signaling by WNT) and R-HSA-3858494 (β-catenin independent WNT signaling).

We applied a novel algorithm in order to identify significant broad ( Supplementary Fig. 1a [href=this file] ) and focal copy number alterations (CNAs) ( Fig. 1a [href=#F1] , Supplementary Tab. 2 [href=this file] ) and observed almost universal deletions affecting 3p and 13q (containing ), frequent gains of 3q, 5p, and losses of 17p (containing ) ( Supplementary Fig. 1a [href=this file] ). However, 3q gains in SCLC were less focal than those in squamous-cell lung cancer ( Supplementary Fig. 1b [href=this file] ). The only significant focal deletion involved ( Fig. 1a [href=#F1] , Supplementary Tab. 2 [href=this file] ).
Statistical significance, expressed by q-values (x-axes), is computed for each genomic location (y-axis) ( Supplementary Information [href=this file] ).
In the 15 primary tumors ( Supplementary Fig. 2 [href=this file] ), did not reach statistical significance, suggesting that amplifications occur later in tumor evolution.
By analyzing transcriptome sequencing data of 15 human tumors we next identified and validated three chimeric transcripts ( Fig. 1e [href=#F1] , Supplementary Tab. 3 [href=this file] ). Two contained a fusion partner that was also mutated, and ( Fig. 1e [href=#F1] ); both of which are predicted to create a loss-of-function of the genes involved ( Supplementary Fig. 3a, b [href=this file] ). This low frequency is in accordance with the spectrum of CNAs in these samples exhibiting almost exclusively arm-level events ( Supplementary Fig. 4a [href=this file] ).
We computed absolute copy numbers from sequencing data in order to correct for admixture of nontumoral cells and for ploidy ( Supplementary Note, Supplementary Fig. 4b [href=this file] ), but found no significant difference between resected and autopsy cases ( Fig. 2a [href=#F2] ).
The analysis is based on absolute copy numbers determined using a reconstruction of the allelic state ( Supplementary Note [href=this file] ).
Compared to global sequencing studies of other tumor types , SCLC exhibits an extremely high mutation rate of 7.4 protein-changing mutations per million basepairs ( Fig. 2b [href=#F2] , Supplementary Fig. 5a [href=this file] ). This high mutation rate is likely linked to tobacco carcinogens, reflected by an elevated rate of C:G>A:T transversions compared to the neutral mutation rate observed in evolution ( Supplementary Fig. 5b [href=this file] ) . In order to identify pathogenetically relevant genes in the context of frequent background mutations we applied several filters, including analyses of a signature of mutational selection and of gene expression ( Fig. 2c [href=#F2] , Supplementary Note [href=this file] ). Remarkably, many of the significant genes were actually not expressed ( Supplementary Tab. 4 [href=this file] ) and none of these mutations were called in the transcriptomes. By contrast, all known tumor suppressors exhibited expression in the upper part of the overall distribution ( Supplementary Fig. 6 [href=this file] ) supporting our strategy for elimination of mutations.
The observed mutation spectrum (2 nonsense, 1 frame-shift deletion, 2 missense) ( Fig. 3a [href=#F3] ) together with frequent genomic losses ( Supplementary Fig. 7a [href=this file] ) suggests that may be a novel tumor suppressor gene in SCLC.
By contrast, the Arg386fs mutation and the – gene fusion truncate the open reading frame in the amino terminus ( Fig. 3c [href=#F3] , Supplementary Fig. 3a [href=this file] ). Thus, even hemizygous deletions occurring in at least 10% of non-mutant samples ( Fig. 3e [href=#F3] ; Supplementary Fig. 7b [href=this file] ) may be considered inactivating.
We developed a mathematical model that gives insight into the allelic state of each tumor and yields estimates of tumor heterogeneity ( Supplementary Note [href=this file] ). On average, we observed a rather low heterogeneity of about 6.5% ( Supplemetary Tab. 5 [href=this file] ). While both tumors contained the identical TP53 mutation (Val73fs), the RB1 mutation (Arg251X) was restricted to the SCLC tumor ( Supplementary Fig. 8 [href=this file] ), compatible with trans-differentiation of adenocarcinoma cells to SCLC cells, mediated in part through loss of .
The allelic state of each exome-sequenced sample was reconstructed by applying a detailed mathematical model ( Supplementary Information [href=this file] ).",pdf,Integrative genome analyses identify key somatic driver mutations of small cell lung cancer - PMC,HTML,"(6.9MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/4915822/bin/NIHMS793416-supplement-Supplemental_Information.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

Consequently, the variance explained by the subtype increased (Figure S1b [this file] ), and the technical and biological replicates from the same cell line showed high similarity according to unsupervised hierarchical clustering results (Figure S1c [this file] ). 
The protein intensity histogram per sample, also highlighting the frequency distribution of imputed values, is shown on Figure S1d [this file] for the samples with the highest missing value content. 
The number of NE (i.e. markers involved in NE differentiation) and non‐NE markers present in our CP data was 19 and 17, respectively (Figure S3a [this file] ). 
Similarly, a gene signature with 22 epithelial and 15 mesenchymal genes published by Kohn et al.[rid=ctm21060-bib-0044] was examined, from which 12 and 10 corresponding proteins were quantified in our CP data (Figure S3b [this file] ). 
Graphical outputs from the ConsensusClusterPlus R package and silhouette plots for = 4 and = 5 are shown in Figure S4a–c [this file] . 
A visual explanation for the filtering steps can be seen in Figure S5 [this file] and a summary of the obtained results in Table S4 [rid=ctm21060-supitem-0005] . 
The gene sets were then filtered for the most representative gene sets (Table S4 [rid=ctm21060-supitem-0005] ), and ssGSEA results for these are depicted in Figure S6 [this file] . 
The performance plot showed that five and four components with centroid distance measure are sufficient for good performance (0.169 and 0.476 balanced error rate) in the CP and CM data, respectively (Figure S7a [this file] ). The sample plots of the first three components in CP (Figure S7b [this file] ) showed that SCLC‐Y is well separated on the first component, SCLC‐A and ‐N are distinguishable on the second component and adding the third component further discriminates SCLC‐P from the rest. The classification performance of these final sPLS‐DA models were 0.113 and 0.484 with centroid distance for CP and CM, respectively (Figure S7c [this file] ). The selected proteins are shown in Supplementary Figure S8 [this file] . 
In general, we identified several members of the Myc proto‐oncogene (MYC) family universally expressed across our samples, such as MYC and protein L‐Myc (MYCL),[rid=ctm21060-bib-0006] or the transcription activator nuclear factor 1 B‐type (Figure S2a [this file] ).[rid=ctm21060-bib-0056] The protein products of and genes, which are well known to be genetically altered in SCLC,[rid=ctm21060-bib-0057] ,[rid=ctm21060-bib-0058] ,[rid=ctm21060-bib-0059] were quantified in 100.0% and 88.5% of the cell lines, respectively, independent of the previously described and mutational status of the cell lines[rid=ctm21060-bib-0035] (Figure S2b [this file] ). Several well‐accepted subtype markers[rid=ctm21060-bib-0003] showed the expected protein expression profile across the subtypes (Figure S2c [this file] ), such as chromogranin‐A (SCLC‐A marker), anthrax toxin receptor 1 (SCLC‐N marker), advillin (SCLC‐P marker) and multiple integrins (SCLC‐Y markers) (Figure 1B [rid=ctm21060-fig-0001] ). 
NE scores built from 19 NE and 17 non‐NE markers,[rid=ctm21060-bib-0007] and EMT scores based on 12 epithelial and 10 mesenchymal markers,[rid=ctm21060-bib-0044] were calculated for each cell line (Figure S3a,b [this file] ). The mean protein abundances of NE, non‐NE, epithelial and mesenchymal markers in each sample are shown in Figure 1D [rid=ctm21060-fig-0001] , whereas the mean NE and EMT scores across the subtypes are depicted in Figure S3c [this file] . In line with these findings, delta‐like protein 3 (DLL3) protein, an inhibitory Notch pathway ligand,[rid=ctm21060-bib-0060] was expressed in decreasing amounts from SCLC‐A to SCLC‐Y, indicating the Notch pathway's gradual activation (Figure S2c [this file] ). 
Comparing NE and EMT scores between cell lines with different properties, such as culture type, cell line origin and treatment with chemotherapy, we found that adherent cell lines harbour significantly lower NE scores than the non‐adherent ones (Figure S3d–f [this file] ). In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between NE and EMT scores (Figure S3g [this file] ). 
To investigate whether proteomic subtyping correlates with the mRNA‐based classification, unsupervised consensus clustering of the CP samples was performed based on the most variable proteins (Figure S4a–c [this file] ). Additionally, two adherent SCLC‐A samples (H1688, DMS53) were rather separated from their group members (Figure S4c [this file] ). 
These steps are described in detail in Section 2 and Figure S5 [this file] . 
In order to verify the subtype‐specificity observed in our cell lines in SCLC tissues as well, we investigated the behaviour of representative gene sets ( = 33) of subtype‐specific processes outlined earlier in the SCLC tissue transcriptomic dataset published by George et al.[rid=ctm21060-bib-0008] ssGSEA identified 22 gene sets for which subtype‐specificity was confirmed to some extent in the tissue data (Figures 5C [rid=ctm21060-fig-0005] and S6 [this file] ). 
In addition to differential expression analysis, sPLS‐DA (Figure S7 [this file] ) was performed separately for CP and CM to identify the proteins that are most suitable for subtype classifications based on their expression patterns (i.e. potential IHC‐ or blood‐based markers). The analysis resulted in 104 proteins (82 and 23 in the CP and CM datasets, respectively; one protein was detected in both datasets) showing clearly distinct profiles between at least two subtypes (Figure S8 [this file] ). Notably, eight of such proteins were found to be overexpressed in SCLC‐Y, including probable glutathione peroxidase 8 ( ), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isoform 2 ( ) and tyrosine–protein kinase receptor UFO ( (Figures 6B [rid=ctm21060-fig-0006] and S9a [this file] ). 
We therefore investigated whether the subtypes showed differences in sensitivity to these drugs, either in GDSC1 or in GDSC2 datasets (Figure S9b [this file] ). This trend was not verified by the GDSC2 dataset for dasatinib; however, median IC50 values of some KIT‐targeting drugs (pazopanib, sunitinib, tivozanib) were lowest in SCLC‐P cell lines, as well as SCLC‐Y subtype's higher resistance to vorinostat could be validated (Figure S9b [this file] ).",docx,In‐depth proteomic analysis reveals unique subtype‐specific signatures in human small‐cell lung cancer,XML,,,,,,,
