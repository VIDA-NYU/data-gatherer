ABCA1-binding complexes were enriched for proteomic analysis (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] A and Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] B). Proteomic analysis revealed 768 shared proteins between rE3 and rE4 treatments, with 314 proteins unique to rE4 (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] C). Nine of these proteins (Supplementary Table 4) showed higher expression in the rE4 treatment group than in the rE3 group (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] D). Reducing caveolin-1, but not, AP2B1 expression by siRNA increased plasma membrane ABCA1 levels in mouse primary astrocytes (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] F, Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] E), supporting that caveolae-mediated endocytosis regulated ABCA1 degradation. Surprisingly, reducing caveolin-1 expression significantly decreased ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] G) despite an increase in total ABCA1 protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] F). Furthermore, overexpression of caveolin-1 in astrocytes enhanced cholesterol efflux (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] G). 
Cholesterol loading, by adding LDL, led to increased caveolin-1 expression (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] H and I) and showed a dose-dependent increase in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] H).",tif,Cellular senescence induced by cholesterol accumulation is mediated by lysosomal ABCA1 in APOE4 and AD,,,,,,,

Indeed, the two groups showed distinct global patterns of pseudogene expression ( Supplementary Fig. 2 [href=this file] ). For each cancer type, we observed generally weak correlations between the expression level of pseudogenes and their WT genes, which is consistent with the previous study ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [href=this file] ). As observed in Kalyana-Sundaram et al. (2012) , we detected some tumor-lineage-specific pseudogenes (296 from the paired-end group and 41 from the single-end group, Supplementary Fig. 4 [href=this file] ). In addition, for three cancer types with available RNA-seq data from nontumor tissue samples, we identified differentially expressed pseudogenes between tumor and nontumor samples (54 in BRCA, 110 in KIRC and 138 in LUSC, Supplementary Fig. 5 [href=this file] ).
For several cancer types with established tumor subtypes, we performed the supervised analysis and revealed substantial numbers of pseudogenes with significant differential expression: 48 in UCEC (endometrioid vs. serous) , 138 in LUSC (basal, classical, primitive and secretory) , 71 in GBM (classical, mesenchymal, neural and proneural) and 547 in BRCA (PAM50 subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, Her2-enriched and normal-like) (Methods, Fig. 2a [href=#F2] , Supplementary Data 1 [href=this file] ).
The predictive power of pseudogene expression is comparable to those achieved by the mRNA expression profiles, suggesting that both pseudogene and mRNA expression can classify the UCEC subtypes independently ( Supplementary Fig. 6 [href=this file] ).
Based on the NMF consensus clustering, 837 BRCA samples can be classified into three distinct subtypes: subtype 1 ( = 144), subtype 2 ( = 390), and subtype 3 ( = 303) ( Fig. 4b [href=#F4] , Supplementary Data 2 [href=this file] ).
Based on the 500 pseudogenes with the most variable expression, we were able to classify 446 KIRC samples into two distinct subtypes ( Fig. 5a [href=#F5] , Supplementary Data 3 [href=this file] ). We observed an enrichment of pseudogenes (115 out of 500) with a statistically significant P-value ( < 0.05) ( Fig. 5c [href=#F5] , Supplementary Data 4 [href=this file] ).
To further assess the clinical utility of the observed pseudogene-expression subtypes, we classified the KIRC samples into four risk quartiles based on the risk scores (in terms of overall survival) calculated from the multivariate Cox model, employing only clinical variables: low risk group (Q1, = 110), low-medium risk group (Q2, = 111), medium-high risk group (Q3, = 112), and high risk group (Q4, = 112) (Methods, Supplementary Data 3 [href=this file] ).
To gain some mechanistic insight into how expressed pseudogenes contribute to the observed KIRC pseudogene-expression subtypes, we performed a systematic analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 9a and Supplementary Data 5 [href=this file] ). Among the WT cognate genes with strong positive correlations with their pseudogenes, we noticed that the survival correlations of individual WT genes with prognostic value match the survival pattern of the pseudogene-expression subtypes: WT genes with better prognosis (potentially tumor suppressors, hazard ratio < 1) show higher expression levels in subtype 1 (the better survival group) and the genes with worse prognosis (potentially oncogenes, hazard ratio > 1) show higher expression levels in subtype 2 (the worse survival group, Supplementary Fig. 8b [href=this file] ). Finally, we examined the classic miRNA decoy model as proposed in Poliseno et al. (2010) and identified 38 such candidates ( Methods and Supplementary Data 5 [href=this file] ). One candidate of interest is the potential regulation of a putative tumor suppressor α-catenin (CTNNA1) by the pseudogene PGOHUM00000257111 through competition for up to 9 shared miRNA regulators ( Supplementary Data 5 [href=this file] ). Indeed, the expression levels of PGOHUM00000257111 were significantly higher in cluster 1 (t-test P = 1.48×10-7), which may lead to the elevated levels of CTNNA1 in subtype 1 ( Supplementary Fig. 8b [href=this file] ) and therefore better survival.
Finally, we performed feature selection ( Supplementary Data 6 [href=this file] ) and built the classifier from the whole training set using the best-performing algorithm (with the highest AUC) identified through the cross-validation, and applied it to the test set in order to independently validate the predictive power.

Meanwhile, we find that deep learning methods are robust for the cross-protocol prediction, while the performance of some statistical methods will drop if the reference and pseudo-bulk data type (UMI to counts or counts to UMI) are exchanged (Supplementary Figs. 1 [this file] and 2 [this file] ). 
Detailed comparison results are available in Supplementary Table 8 [this file] . For the “similar” scenario, we investigated TAPE’s performance on distinguishing similar cell types (CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell) in all the three PBMC datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). With 13 defined cell subtypes (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ), all the methods can not achieve satisfying results (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , median CCC < 0.1), which clearly shows the common limitation of current methods. 
In Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , the two colors stand for the different methods, and the two coordinates of each dot represent overall MAE and CCC for all cell types respectively. 
From the results (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ), we can have four conclusions: (1) TAPE’s predictive power is better than CIBERSORTx when the randomly selected DEGs are less than 1000; (2) both methods can achieve good performance when the DEGs are signature genes and there are not any similar cell types; (3) both methods can not distinguish DEGs from CD8 T cell rather than CD4 T cell if the DEGs are randomly selected; (4) CIBERSORTx is better than TAPE if the DEGs are signature genes and there exist similar cell types. 
The results show that TAPE only predicts and as DEGs in NK cell and no DEGs for other cell types (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
Firstly, when we study the correlation at the gene level using “overall” mode (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ), about 30% of the predicted genes have the negative correlation. However, this phenomenon can also be observed in CIBERSORTx (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), which indicates the information loss between bulk samples and inferred cell-type-specific GEP is hard to be reconstructed. Thirdly, we notice that both CIBERSORTx and our method can not distinguish DEGs from similar cell subtypes correctly if the DEGs are not signature genes (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ) which means that their resolution is still limited. But CIBERSORTx has displayed its advantages in distinguishing signature DEGs from similar cell types because of the incorporation of the signature matrix (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ). 
When we used it to test whether deconvolution methods can achieve good performance with immune cell subtypes, we merged all 30 cell types into 13 cell subtypes (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
This step is very important, because TAPE will fail in predicting test bulk data proportions properly without proper filtering (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] and Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ) . If the less variable genes are not filtered out, TAPE can not predict a good result because of the noises (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] and Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ).

To reveal heterogeneity within oligodendrocytes, we grouped the aforementioned oligodendrocytes into six classes described in a published database , as follows (Fig. 1a [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] –d and 3a [this file] ): (1) Differentiation-committed oligodendrocyte precursors (COPs) and newly formed oligodendrocytes (NFOL) that express Sox6, Pdgfra, and Cspg4. (2) Myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (MFOL) that express Ctps, Ablims, and Thbs3. (3) Mature oligodendrocytes 1, 2 (MOL 1, 2) that express Il33, Ptgds, and Opalin. (4) Mature oligodendrocytes 3, 4 (MOL 3, 4) that express Klk6, S100b, Anxa5, Cd59a and Mgst3. Moreover, we discovered an additional oligodendrocyte cluster, which gradually increased in the 3-, 6-month-old App KI mice (Fig. 1b–d [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). This cluster was present in the UMAP plot even with down-sampled data (400, 1,200, and 2,400 cells) (Supplementary Fig. 2f [this file] ). Remarkably, we found that this cluster shared some signatures with MOL2, while Alzheimer’s disease risk factors such as C4b, Apoe and Cd74 are strongly expressed (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] , 3a [this file] , 3b [this file] , and Source data file). 
We further confirmed the lineage transitions of DAOs and homeostatic MOLs from COP and NFOL in control and AD brains (Fig. 1e–g [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ), but density from the DAO cluster exclusively appeared in 3 and 6-month-old AD brains (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] g). 
We reanalyzed previously published single-cell transcriptome datasets from postmortem AD brains (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c [this file] ) . 
Notably, consistent with scRNA-seq results, we observed a significant increase in Mbp + , Cd74+ oligodendrocytes in 3- and 6-month-old App KI and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, whereas the number of NeuroD1+ post-mitotic neurons significantly decreased (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] a, b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 6a–c [this file] , and Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] , b [this file] ). We further confirmed an increase in Cd74+ and Oligo2+ AD-associated oligodendrocytes in App KI mice using flow cytometry (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] c, d [rid=Fig2] , and Supplementary Fig. 6d [this file] ). 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that 6-month-old App KI mice exhibited a thinner myelin layer relative to the axon diameter (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] and supplementary fig. 8 [this file] ). 
Consistently, we found a significant increase in Mbp+ and Cd74+ DAOs in the hippocampus of premature progeria (6-month-old) and 13-month-old mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d [this file] ), whereas the number of NeuroD1-positive post-mitotic neurons decreased in the hippocampus of 13-month-old mice (Supplementary Fig. 9e and f [this file] ). We further confirmed that the genes enriched in DAOs were highly correlated with gene signatures shown in the aged human brain (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b [this file] ), indicating that Cd74-positive DAOs increased in the aged brains and had transcriptional profiles more similar to the aged human brain. 
In particular, we found significant alternations in the transcriptional profiles between DAOs and MOL 3/4 clusters and GO-term of up-regulated genes in DAO versus MOL3/4 showed the interleukin & chemokine production and ERK signaling (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] a and c [rid=Fig3] ), which was also confirmed during the disease progression in AD mice brain (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] ). 
We first identified microglia with a high DAM module score based on previously published DAM signatures (Supplementary Fig. 1e [this file] , 12a, b [this file] ), that gradually increased during AD progression (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] e, f [rid=Fig3] , and Supplementary Fig. 12c [this file] ). 
Supplementary Fig. 13a–c [this file] shows efficient inhibition of phosphor 44/42 MAPK signaling in primary oligodendrocytes upon treatment with 200 ng/ml SCH772984, a specific Erk1 and Erk2 inhibitor. Remarkably, oligodendrocytes treated with SCH772984 exhibited a significant increase in Mbp+ branching compared with the controls, whereas the number of Cd74+ cells significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 13d [this file] , 13e [this file] , and Fig. 4a–c [rid=Fig4] ). 
First, in order to examine the potential interactions between DAOs and other neuronal cell types, AD DAOs were co-cultured with AD neurons, astrocytes, and microglia treated with SCH772984 (Supplementary Fig. 14a [this file] ). We found that AD DAOs with other neuronal cell types did not increase the number of Mbp+ branches in the presence and absence of SCH772984 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 14b–f [this file] ), suggesting that inhibition of ERK/MAPK signaling in other neuronal cell types did not contribute to the phenotypic changes in DAOs (Fig. 4d–f [rid=Fig4] ). Moreover, to investigate whether other neural cell types can contribute to the AD-associated phenotypes via ERK signaling, each of the neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes isolated from AD mice were subjected to SCH772984 treatment, and AD pathology was determined after co-culture with the remaining untreated AD neuronal cell types (Supplementary Fig. 15a [this file] ). Remarkably, we found that ERK1/2-inhibited oligodendrocytes significantly diminished the Aβ42/40 ratio in the AD primary neuronal cultures (Supplementary Fig. 15b [this file] ). Also, we observed a decrease in the amyloidogenic processing marker C99 in the AD neuronal cultures with SCH772984 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 15c–e [this file] ), indicating that AD oligodendrocytes predominantly contribute to the pathophysiology of AD via ERK signaling. 
Consistent with previous results, systemic administration of SCH772984 significantly reduced the occurrence of DAOs in the hippocampus of App KI mice (Fig. 5b, c [rid=Fig5] , and Supplementary Fig. 16a–d [this file] ) but not Cd74 + Iba1+ microglia (Supplementary Fig. 16c, d [this file] ). 
Moreover, we confirmed a decrease in the number of Aβ plaques (Fig. 5m, n [rid=Fig5] ), coupled with an increase in the number of NeuroD1+ cells in the SCH772984-treated AD mouse hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 16e, f [this file] ).

For LDL cholesterol, which had the best-powered GWAS of the three traits we considered, we identified 38 protein pairs with a significant co-expression effect ( Supplementary Figure 2 [this file] ). 
By visualizing significant COWAS pairs as a network, we identified complexes of mutually interacting proteins that modulate LDL cholesterol levels ( Supplementary Figure 3 [this file] ). For example, we found that APOE and PLTP both decrease LDL cholesterol levels, while their co-expression is associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels ( Supplementary Figure 4 [this file] ). 
Effect sizes, standard errors, and values for the pairs shown in Figure 3 [rid=F3] are also summarized in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] . 
Results for protein pairs identified as significant using at least one of these three tests with IGAP GWAS data are shown in Supplementary Figure 5 [this file] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] . 
Finally, we considered an alternative, product-based formulation of COWAS (see Supplementary Note 1 [this file] for details). The mean out-of-sample for product-based co-expression imputation models was slightly higher than for any of the residual-based co-expression imputation models, and over 99% of well-imputed pairs again had a nominally significant correlation between imputed and observed expression ( Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] and Supplementary Data 1 [rid=SD2] ). 
We also discovered 22 pairs with an overall effect on AD using the product-based COWAS global test and EADB summary statistics ( Supplementary Figure 7 [this file] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). Full results for AD using the product-based version of COWAS are provided in Supplementary Figure 7 [this file] , Supplementary Table 3 [this file] , and Supplementary Data 18 [rid=SD2] – 19 [rid=SD2] . 
Effect sizes, standard errors, and values for the pairs shown in Figure 4 [rid=F4] are also summarized in Supplementary Table 4 [this file] . 
In Supplementary Note 1 [this file] we define an alternative, product-based version of COWAS in which is replaced with . 
In Supplementary Note 2 [this file] we derive a summary-level version of the second stage following the approach introduced in the multivariate imaging-wide association study (MV-IWAS) method [ 14 [rid=R14] , 16 [rid=R16] ], which is related to other methods in the field of Mendelian randomization [ 87 [rid=R87] , 88 [rid=R88] ].

Among these well-imputed pairs, lasso regression with -pQTLs pre-screened by their effect sizes achieved the highest mean out-of-sample for predicting co-expression (mean , Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). On the other hand, ridge regression with both -pQTLs and -pQTLs pre-screened by their values yielded the greatest number of well-imputed protein pairs ( Figure 2d [rid=F2] and Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ).

More details for the distribution of brain 5hmC data can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] – 3 [this file] . 
Of the 2821 DhMRs (606 associated with AD diagnosis, 1542 associated with Aβ load, 1399 associated with PHFtau tangles, annotated to 2642 distinct genes) identified in stage II (replication), about 69% reside in exons, ~15% in intergenic regions, and ~17% in introns (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). Compared to non-AD associated 5hmC regions (total 194,944), AD-associated regions (total 2821) were significantly more likely to coincide with regions related to transcription start site (TSS), transcription states, and enhancer states, but less likely to co-position with regions corresponding to heterochromatin and quiescent states (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] , Supplementary Data 20 [rid=MOESM22] ). 
Of these, 108 AD-associated, 581 Aβ-associated and 135 PHFtau-associated 5hmC regions were positively correlated with gene expression, whereas 65 AD-associated, 240 Aβ-associated and 53 PHFtau-associated 5hmC regions were negatively correlated with gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] , Supplementary Data 22 [rid=MOESM24] ). These genes were clustered into multiple protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). The most significant biological processes and pathways of these functional clusters were associated with mTOR signaling, mediator complex and transcriptional regulation of RNA polymerase transcripts (II and III), SWI/SNF and npBAF complex, γ-secretase complex, DNA replication and repair, etc. (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , Supplementary Data 24 [rid=MOESM26] ). 
At GWAS threshold of 1 × 10 , genetic variants residing in regions harboring AD-associated 5hmC alterations were significantly enriched in DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), transcribed histone modifications, TSS, and transcribed chromatin states, but depleted in repressed chromatin states and H3K27me3 in various tissues such as blood, blood vessel, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), colon, liver, and fetal intestine(Supplementary Figs. 7 [this file] – 9 [this file] ; Supplementary Data 30 [rid=MOESM32] – 32 [rid=MOESM34] ). 
We also performed colocalization analysis using summary statistics from a cell-type specific -eQTL analysis of eight human brain cell types and found that one of the colocalized genes, , is expressed in both astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ) and microglia (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ).",pdf,Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology,,,,,,,

For trials reporting event-free survival data (e.g., PFS; Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ) median = 0.950 (Q1 = 0.909, mean: 0.929, Q3 = 0.970) as compared to a theoretical maximal = 0.996, which corresponds to 5% of observed variance not explained by the Weibull model. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2a, b [this file] for Weibull fits to OS and PFS data for panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI and for FOLFIRI alone in wild-type and mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (trial 20050181 ; average = 0.99 for OS curves and 0.92 for PFS curves). 
Across the entire data set, some of the worst fits for two-parameter Weibull forms were observed for trials with relatively few events, for example, the Chronicle trial ( NCT00427713 (NCT00427713) ) with only eight deaths in the treatment arm and 16 progression events in the observation arm (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
For a small number of trials in which the asymptote of the fitted survival curve was greater than zero (i.e., patients were expected to be alive at the end of the longest follow-up), a three-parameter Weibull distribution consisting of the traditional two-parameter distribution with an additional “cure rate” term had an improved fit (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). 
This is potentially consistent with a two-population hypothesis (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Moreover, a mixture model exhibited no meaningful improvement in fit as compared to a single-distribution for OS data from ICI or control arms in these trials (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). This generated the steep decline in PFS values observable in the control and experimental arms of actual ICI trials, and improved fit to PFS distributions, raising mean from 0.93 to 0.98 (Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ; “Methods”). 
A challenge in the analysis of such data is that, when too few events have occurred, nonparametric numeric confidence estimates return non-informative values (usually reported as a value “not reached” or “indeterminate” as illustrated for two different scenarios in Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). We found that 12-month survival estimates were non-informative for 20–40% of OS trial arms, and 23–61% of event-free survival trial arms, with higher failure rates occurring when the sample size was smaller (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c [this file] ). 
For event-free survival (for which 99 event-free survival curves could be compared), the precision of a Weibull-based approach was also greater than a nonparametric approach across all sample sizes, while accuracy was equivalent for small sample sizes (fewer than 40 patients) (Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ). 
Thus, parametric fitting of data from 15 patients made a comparably precise and accurate estimate of median PFS as nonparametric analysis of 60 patients (Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). 
We observed that for a representative simulation, a two-parameter Weibull form accurately described the synthetic trial data ( = 0.98; Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
Parameter values for trials reporting event-free survival followed a similar pattern to OS values (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ). 
A similar pattern was observed for event-free survival data, with control and experimental values differing by 1.0% for unsuccessful trials and 36% for successful trials (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
For event-free survival data, 155 comparisons of experimental and control arms from 146 trial figures revealed a range of Δ values from +0.55 to −0.85 (median |Δ | = 0.08) (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ).

To investigate the variant-level overlap among -e/iso/sQTLs, we calculated Storey’s pi1 statistic ( 40 [rid=R40] ) and found that genetic variants directly associated with RNA splicing (especially isoQTL) capture independent and additional signals from eQTLs ( Fig. 1H [rid=F1] ; Methods [this file] ).

Following the multi-ancestry QTL mapping pipeline, we independently mapped xQTLs in the three largest ancestry groupings: EUR, AMR, and AFR. 986 eGenes were shared between the multi-ancestry dataset and the three ancestry groupings ( Fig. 2B [rid=F2] ; Table S2 [this file] ). We then performed statistical fine-mapping separately in the ancestry groupings ( 42 [rid=R42] ), and show that AFR, despite of the smallest sample size, has on average the smallest credible sets (CS) of causal variants ( Fig. 2D [rid=F2] ; Data S2 [this file] , S3 [this file] , S4 [this file] ). 
S7 [this file] ; Table S3 [this file] ). Mirroring eQTL results, we found that heritability drops significantly from Tri1 to Tri2 ( Fig. 3C [rid=F3] ; Wilcoxon p < 2.2e-16; Table S3 [this file] ; Data S5 [this file] , S6 [this file] ).

We generated continuous annotations for genetic variants based on fine-mapping posterior probabilities ( 51 [rid=R51] ) and found SCZ GWAS signals to be highly enriched among fetal brain regulatory elements -- more so than in the adult brain ( Fig. 4B [rid=F4] ; Table S4 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S9 [this file] ; Table S4 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S9 [this file] ; Table S4 [this file] ). 
Across these traits, we consistently observed greater heritability mediated by isoform regulation (isoform h /h 6.45±1.92%) than that of gene expression (3.15±1.25%) or splicing (2.13±1.74%), although the overall extent of mediation remains small ( Fig. 4C [rid=F4] ; Table S4 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). Extending these analyses across trimester-specific annotations, although less well powered, pointed to isoform-regulation in Tri2 as being particularly important, especially for BIP ( Fig. 4D [rid=F4] ; Table S4 [this file] ).

Other novel disease mechanisms prioritized by these analyses include: downregulation of the GABA -receptor subunit in SCZ (eQTL: rs514733, CLPP=0.32; Fig. 5B [rid=F5] ; Table S5 [this file] ), providing genetic evidence for GABAergic dysfunction hypothesized to contribute to disease pathophysiology ( 60 [rid=R60] ); splicing dysregulation of in BIP (top colocalization sQTL: rs11750832, CLPP=0.97; Fig. S10 [this file] ; Table S5 [this file] ) which encodes adenylate cyclase, a cell membrane-bound enzyme regulating cAMP signaling and a target of the mood stabilizer lithium ( 61 [rid=R61] ); splicing dysregulation in BIP of (sQTL: rs17183814, CLPP=0.70; Fig. S10 [this file] ; Table S5 [this file] ), a voltage gated sodium channel subunit with rare variant associations in ASD and epilepsy ( 62 [rid=R62] , 63 [rid=R63] ); and in MDD, the dysregulated splicing of (CLPP=0.43; Fig. S10 [this file] ; Table S5 [this file] ), a highly constrained E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and regulator of N6-methyladenosine RNA modification involved in neural-immune activation ( 64 [rid=R64] ). 
We next conducted an isoform-centric transcriptome-wide association study (isoTWAS) ( 65 [rid=R65] ), to identify genes and their isoforms whose regulated expression is associated with SCZ risk. isoTWAS identified 536 isoforms across 271 unique genes with significant isoTWAS associations (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05 across genes, FWER-corrected P < 0.05 across transcripts of the same gene, permutation P < 0.05; Methods [this file] ). To leverage local LD and to account for SNP weight correlations, we performed fine-mapping on isoTWAS associations that passed permutation testing ( Fig. 5D [rid=F5] ; Table S5 [this file] ). 
Among 14 TWAS-identified genes with >3 conditionally independent eQTLs, the MRLocus framework provided additional support for 7 genes with FDR<0.2 ( Table S5 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S11 [this file] ). 
In total, we identified 124 gene and isoform co-expression modules demonstrating enrichment for all major developmental cell types ( 36 [rid=R36] ) and recapitulating early biochemical processes and developmental pathways ( Fig. 6A [rid=F6] ; Methods [this file] ). 
Overlaying enrichment for common and rare variation within the hierarchical structure defined by co-expression pinpointed groups of modules that harbor most of neurodevelopmental disease risk ( Fig. 6B [rid=F6] ; Table S6 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S12 [this file] ).

S12 [this file] ) displayed robust BIP, education attainment (EA), and SCZ enrichment while harboring high risk hub genes like and – similar to the prenatally-enriched M37 module described in Li et al ( 18 [rid=R18] ). S12 [this file] ). 
CellWalker mapped 21.7% of eQTL-containing genes to a specific cellular context in the developing human brain, corresponding to 3,739 of the bulk-derived eQTLs ( Fig. 7A [rid=F7] ; Table S7 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). To identify such ieQTLs, in which SNP-gene associations are modulated by the levels of a given module, we tested the interaction effect between genotype and module eigengenes on gene and isoform expression ( Fig. 7B [rid=F7] ; Methods [this file] ). Across all gene and isoform modules, 8,008 ieQTLs were identified after the permutation test (BH-corrected FDR<0.05; Methods [this file] ), in which 3,960 ieQTLs were specific to a single module ( Fig. 7C [rid=F7] ; Data S9 [this file] ). Finally, integrating disease GWAS, we identified significant colocalizations (CLPP>0.01) between ieQTLs and 22 SCZ GWAS loci, 13 of which are not found with bulk cA-eQTLs ( Table S5 [this file] ).

The analysis split ADNI participants into two clusters, 2 and 3, at the top of the tree, with significantly different levels of p-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), glucose uptake measured by [ F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and the 13-item AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog. 13; Fig. 2b [rid=F2] - d [rid=F2] , Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). All associations remained significant ( Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
Specifically, we examined acylcarnitine-related SNPs reported by Shin et al. as non-modifiable factors (SNP list is provided in Supplementary Table 5 [this file] , replication in ADNI in Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ) and modifiable acylcarnitine levels (i.e., residuals adjusted for genetic and other non-modifiable factors) to better understand their impact on subgroup separation. 
Genetic influences only accounted for a small proportion of variance ( Supplementary Table 7 [this file] - 9 [this file] ), except for one epistatic interaction effect of two SNPs: The interplay of rs17806888 (mapped to ) and rs924135 (mapped to ), both of which have been reported to affect succinylcarnitine levels , explained 32% of the initial partitioning of the data into cluster 2 and cluster 3 at the top of the tree ( Fig. 2j [rid=F2] and Supplementary Fig. 2 [rid=SD2] ). When we examined relations to AD, we observed that both single acylcarnitine-related SNPs and epistatic models were not strongly linked to AD and its biomarkers, although some associations were independently confirmed in the MayoLOAD and ROS/MAP studies ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [rid=SD2] and Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ). 
After cross-normalizing the different cohort datasets for better comparability ( Methods [rid=S6] and Supplementary Fig. 4 [rid=SD2] ), we fitted a multivariable linear model that regresses age on the fasting serum levels of acylcarnitines in the KORA cohort ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [rid=SD2] and Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ). When applied to the ADNI cohort, correlation dropped to 28% (cognitively normal participants only), which was very similar to what we observed when replicating the bioenergetic age computation process in AGES-RS (r = 29%, Supplementary Table 12 [this file] ). 
Bioenergetic age highlighted interesting relationships between subgroups and AD pathology throughout the tree ( Supplementary Table 13 [this file] ). This was further confirmed by significant associations of bioenergetic age with AD biomarkers across the A-T-(N)-(C) spectrum ( Supplementary Table 14 [this file] ), and consistent findings for cognitive function and grey matter volume in AGES-RS ( Supplementary Table 15 [this file] ). 
Specifically, bioenergetically younger individuals demonstrated a significantly slower decline over five years ( Supplementary Table 16 [this file] ). This result was replicated using longitudinal diagnosis data from the AGES-RS study ( Fig. 4d [rid=F4] , Supplementary Table 15 [this file] ), providing further evidence that younger bioenergetic age is protective against cognitive decline. 
We selected the grouping that had the most significant associations across three cognitive measures: ADAS-Cog 13, memory, and executive function ( Supplementary Table 17 [this file] ). 
The final dataset contained 140 metabolite measurements, covering 23 acylcarnitine species ( Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ), for 1,531 individuals. 
Data for 22 out of 23 acylcarnitines investigated in ADNI ( Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ) were available here, with the exception being levels of C4:1, which was not reliably measured in KORA. 
We obtained a list of 32 acylcarnitine-associated SNPs ( Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ) from a large GWAS study performed on a total of 7,824 individuals from the KORA and TwinsUK studies . 
To investigate robustness of the model, we performed 10-fold, 3 times repeated cross-validation ( Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ).",xlsx,Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease,,,,,,,

Furthermore, this analysis revealed a strong correlation between bioenergetic age and the first principal component of acylcarnitine levels, indicating that the primary axis of variation in the data and the clustering is associated with bioenergetic age ( Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Rather, we found that individuals within cluster 7 consistently exhibit the same chronological but significantly younger bioenergetic age than other participants irrespective of their diagnostic group ( Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ).

As expected, no difference was observed for WBGs between prenatal and postnatal stages ( = 0.27, Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, in GTEx data, we observed that nearest non-HRG genes are highly expressed in a majority of brain tissues while non-nearest HRGs are not ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ).

We performed iRIGS on these loci to identify risk genes of SCZ ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
We also tried other thresholds to define LBGs, and the enrichment patterns are similar ( Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
We found that NRGs are indeed connected to more DREs in Hi-C and FANTOM5 data ( Fig. 2b [rid=F2] , Supplementary Fig. 1 [rid=SD1] , Methods [rid=S15] , and Supplementary Note [this file] ). 
We therefore integrated them into iRIGS ( Methods [rid=S15] ) and predicted 104 high-confident risk genes (HRGs) in total ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
We found that non-nearest HRGs are more significantly enriched in the gene sets compared to nearest non-HRG genes ( Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ), suggesting that the 65 non-nearest HRGs identified by iRIGS are more likely to be true risk genes than their nearest counterparts.

Cells with consistent cell type annotations were combined with the CellRef Seed to form the LungMAP Human Lung CellRef (347,970 cells) (Fig. 2B [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Figs. 1 [this file] – 3 [this file] , “Methods”). 
Using the same approach, we constructed a cell type dictionary based on the LungMAP CellCards to define cell types in mouse lung during perinatal development, identified seed cells for each cell type (termed LungMAP Mouse Lung Development CellRef Seed”), and constructed a CellRef for mouse lung development (denoted as LungMAP Mouse Lung Development CellRef) using Drop-seq of mouse lungs ( = 95,658, 8 time points, 17 samples) from embryonic day 16.5 to postnatal day 28 (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM5] , 4 [rid=MOESM6] ). 
These tools provide highly interactive search, analyzing, and visualization functionalities for users to explore and reanalyze cell type and gene expression patterns provided by the LungMAP CellRefs (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). Users can also select and highlight cells of interest (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Evaluation of the other three test data samples were shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] . 
As shown in Fig. 5D–I [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] , predicted cell types were well separated and formed clusters. Cell-type-specific marker genes from CellCards were selectively expressed in each predicted cell type, supporting the concordance of the cell identities (Fig. 5E, F [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). The median values of all metrics are greater than 0.92 (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), supporting the high consistency of the automated CellRef cell type prediction with the original cell annotations. Both the LungMAP human and mouse lung CellRefs achieved high cross validation performance with ~0.92 median F1 and MCC scores for the human lung CellRef and 0.98 median F1 and MCC scores for the mouse lung CellRef, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
We summarized the one-to-one mapped cell types and the unique cell types/states in the Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] . 
Similarly, when applying these stability metrics to CellRef and HLCA using their own data collections, CellRef produced slightly higher scores on SCCAF and TF-IDF; as well as a significantly higher score on cell re-assignment ( = 0.011) as compared to HLCA (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). scTriangulate leverages the computed stability scores to further assess the marginal importance of each annotation (CellRef and HLCA) using a cooperative game theory framework. scTriangulate predicted that 50% ( = 24/48) of the CellRef cell types to be of higher confidence (AEC, AF1, AF2, AM, ASMC, CD8 T, cDC1, cDC2, Ciliated, Goblet, Ionocyte, LEC, Platelet, pMON, Suprabasal, SVEC, VSMC), compared to 46% ( = 27/58) of the HCLA cell types (AT2, aCAP, Pericyte, Mesothelium, Peribronchial fibroblasts and Adventitial fibroblasts, etc.) (Fig. 8D [rid=Fig8] ). 
The overall distributions of iLISI scores in both CellRef and HLCA are not ideal, on average about 15% for CellRef, and 5% for HLCA, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ), likely due to that both atlases were constructed using large collections of heterogeneous data from different biological regions and conditions rather than a well-designed balanced cohort. Nevertheless, CellRef consistently outperforms HLCA on the measurements of iLISI, and has the cLISI scores close to 1, indicating a well separation of the CellRef cell types (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
Results supported the high accuracy, cluster stability, and marker specificity of our mouse lung reference cell types (Supplementary Fig. 12 [this file] ; mean AUC 95.8, mean SCCAF score: 0.970, mean Reassign score: 0.881, mean TFID10 score: 0.892).",pdf,Guided construction of single cell reference for human and mouse lung,,,,,,,

The resulting “star subnetworks” centered on the hot node ( Supplementary Figure 2 [href=this file] ; Online Methods) contain many neighboring genes that are not mutated at appreciable frequency and are of limited biological interest.
We introduce the HotNet2 (HotNet iffusion riented ubnetworks) algorithm to address the problem of finding significantly mutated subnetworks on large, broad mutation frequency spectrum datasets like Pan-Cancer ( Figure 1c [href=#F1] and Supplementary Figure 3 [href=this file] ). HotNet2 uses a modified diffusion process and considers the source, or directionality, of heat flow in the identification of subnetworks ( Supplementary Figure 4 [href=this file] ).
We combined the resulting subnetworks into 14 consensus subnetworks that were found across different gene scores and networks ( < 0.004, Supplementary Table 3 [href=#SD2] ), plus the condensin complex and CLASP/CLIP proteins ( Supplementary Figure 5 [href=this file] ) that were significant in individual interaction networks ( Supplementary Tables 6,7 [href=#SD2] ). We developed an online interactive viewer (see URLs and Supplementary Figure 6 [href=this file] ) for Pan-Cancer HotNet2 subnetworks.
The subnetworks and linker genes ( Figure 2a [href=#F2] ) include: portions of well-known cancer pathways such as TP53, PI3K, NOTCH, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; Supplementary Figure 7 [href=this file] ), as well as pathways and complexes that have more recently been observed to be important in cancer such as SWI/SNF complex, BAP1 complex, NFE2L2-KEAP1 ( Supplementary Figures 8,9 [href=this file] ), and RUNX1-CBFB core binding complex ( Supplementary Figure 10 [href=this file] ). The fifth most mutated subnetwork (16.9% of samples) consists of MLL2 and MLL3 and the putative interacting protein KDM6A ( Supplementary Figure 11 [href=this file] ), and was highly mutated (28.9% of samples) in TCGA Pan-Cancer squamous integrated subtype . The MHC Class I subnetwork ( Supplementary Figure 12 [href=this file] ) is an example of the ability of HotNet2 ability to identify rarely mutated cancer genes; all of the genes in the subnetwork are mutated in fewer than 35 samples (1.1%), yet four of the five genes have recently been proposed as novel cancer genes . Additional analyses are in the Supplementary Note [href=this file] .
To obtain additional support for these genes we examined whether they had either an excess of inactivating mutations or a cluster of missense mutations in protein sequence (using NMC ) or in protein structure (using iPAC ; Supplementary Figures 13,14 [href=this file] and Supplementary Tables 21,22 [href=#SD2] ). We find that genes in HotNet2 consensus subnetworks are enriched for inactivating mutations ( < 0.0001) or mutation clusters ( < 0.0001) compared to genes not in subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 6–18 [href=#SD2] and Supplementary Note Section 5.1 [href=this file] ). Finally, we evaluated a subset of the mutations in these genes using RNA-Seq and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the same samples, and found RNA-Seq and/or WGS reads that validated 39 mutations in these novel genes ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 23 [href=#SD2] ).
This exclusivity was largely due to LUAD samples with mutually exclusive and mutations ( Supplementary Figure 15 [href=this file] ).
The three largest subnetworks – including a subnetwork, a subnetwork, and a subnetwork – contain many well-known cancer genes ( Supplementary Tables 8–10 [href=#SD2] and Supplementary Figures 16,17 [href=this file] ).
The subnetwork also includes , which has a significant ( < 8×10 ) cluster of missense mutations ( Supplementary Figure 18 [href=this file] ).
We find that mutations in the SWI/SNF and BAP1 complexes show even greater mutual exclusivity ( =9.4×10 ) in KIRC because of mutations in additional genes in these complexes besides and , respectively ( Supplementary Note Section 5.8.1 [href=this file] ).
Finally, RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing data from the same samples provide further validation of the somatic mutations in , , , , , and and show that some of these mutations are expressed ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 39 [href=#SD2] ).
Our analysis complements other recent Pan-Cancer analyses including studies that analyze only one type of aberration or restrict attention to recurrent aberrations ( Supplementary Note Section 8.3 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 27 [href=#SD2] ).
We selected the threshold of 400 aberrations per sample as the derivative of the number of mutations per sample starts increasing rapidly beyond this value ( Supplementary Figure 19 [href=this file] ). Finally, we used only those genes that had at least 3 reads from RNA-seq data in at least 70% of samples of at least one of the cancer types, as described in The resulting dataset contained aberrations in 11,565 genes and 3110 samples ( Supplementary Figure 1 [href=this file] ). Additional details of the datasets are in the Supplementary Note [href=this file] .
While interaction networks have proven useful in analyzing various types of genomic data , statistically robust identification of significantly mutated subnetworks is a difficult problem with several major challenges ( Supplemental Note Section 1.1 [href=this file] ). HotNet2 addresses these challenges and identifies significantly mutated subnetworks of a genome-scale interaction network, using an insulated heat diffusion process that considers both the scores on individual genes/proteins as well as the topology of interactions between genes/proteins ( Supplementary Figure 3 [href=this file] ).
The insulated heat model can also described in terms of a random walk with restart ( Supplementary Note Section 1.2 [href=this file] ).
Since the diffusion matrix is not symmetric and in general ( ) ≠ ( ), the similarity ( , ) is also not symmetric ( Supplementary Note Section 1.2.1 [href=this file] ).
The statistical test is the same as the two-stage statistical test introduced in the original HotNet algorithm ( Supplementary Note Section 1.3 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figures 20–23 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 28 [href=#SD2] ).
HotNet2 has two parameters β and δ, and selects values for both of these parameters using procedures. β is selected from the protein-protein interaction network, of any gene scores ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.1 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figure 24 [href=this file] , and Supplementary Table 29 [href=#SD2] ). The value of δ is chosen such that large connected components are not found using the observed gene score distribution on random networks with the same degree distribution as the observed network ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.2 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figure 25 [href=this file] , and Supplementary Table 30 [href=#SD2] ).
See Supplementary Figure 2 [href=this file] .
Expanding on this third point, when undirected diffusion algorithms like HotNet or related network propagation algorithms are run on large datasets containing a wide range of gene scores (e.g. the Pan-Cancer dataset), many of the resulting subnetworks are “hot” determined by a single high-scoring node and the immediate neighbors of this node ( Supplementary Figure 2 [href=this file] ).
The HotNet2 subnetworks also have a higher fraction of interactions with proteins other than a hot central node ( Supplementary Note Section 7.1 [href=this file] ). In short, the results show that HotNet2 achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than HotNet ( Supplementary Note Section 7.2 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 26 [href=this file] ).
We find that HotNet2 provides both new insights and a simpler summary of groups of interacting genes, and is a useful complement (or arguably a replacement for) other pathway tests ( Supplementary Note Section 8.1 [href=this file] ). We also show that HotNet2 has much higher specificity than HotNet, DAVID, and GSEA in identifying genes satisfying the 20/20 rule ( Supplementary Note Section 8.1.4 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figure 27 [href=this file] , and Supplementary Tables 34–36 [href=#SD2] ). Finally, we find that HotNet2 was more stable than HotNet in identifying 20/20 genes using cross-validation ( Supplementary Note Section 7.3 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 28 [href=this file] ).
We found that MEMo was unable to run on the Pan-Cancer mutation frequency dataset, consistent with the authors’ recommendation that MEMo should be run only on a small number of significant mutations (details in Supplementary Note Section 8.2 [href=this file] ).
We ran HotNet2 on each combination of gene scores (mutation frequency and MutSigCV -values; see Supplementary Note Section 2.2 [href=this file] ) and interaction networks (HINT+HI2012 , iRefIndex , and Multinet ; Supplementary Note Section 2.5 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 29 [href=this file] ). This procedure is described in Supplementary Note Section 1.5 [href=this file] .
Additional details of the statistical procedure are in Supplementary Note Section 1.3 [href=this file] .
Notable among the additional subnetworks identified when we remove the requirement for RNA-Seq expression is a subnetwork ( Supplementary Table 25 [href=#SD2] ) containing members of the telomerase complex (including and ) that has a well-studied role in cancer ( Supplementary Figure 30 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 38 [href=#SD2] ).",pdf,Pan-Cancer Network Analysis Identifies Combinations of Rare Somatic Mutations across Pathways and Protein Complexes - PMC,"(13.8MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/4444046/bin/NIHMS644198-supplement-1.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

We combined the resulting subnetworks into 14 consensus subnetworks that were found across different gene scores and networks ( < 0.004, Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ), plus the condensin complex and CLASP/CLIP proteins ( Supplementary Figure 5 [href=#SD1] ) that were significant in individual interaction networks ( Supplementary Tables 6,7 [href=this file] ).
Many of the subnetworks exhibit a significant enrichment for mutations in a subset of cancer types, including many previously unreported associations ( Supplementary Tables 6–18 [href=this file] ). In addition, the HotNet2 Pan-Cancer analysis provides a clearer and more robust summary of subnetworks and novel genes than HotNet2 analysis of individual cancer types ( Supplementary Table 19 [href=this file] ).
These subnetworks and linkers include a total of 147 genes, including many well-known cancer genes and pathways, but also including genes with mutations that are too rare to be significant by the single-gene tests ( Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] ). Table 1 [href=#T1] lists a subset of promising candidates, with the full list and associated references in Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] .
More information on these genes – as well as other candidate driver genes – is in Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] .
To obtain additional support for these genes we examined whether they had either an excess of inactivating mutations or a cluster of missense mutations in protein sequence (using NMC ) or in protein structure (using iPAC ; Supplementary Figures 13,14 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Tables 21,22 [href=this file] ). We find that genes in HotNet2 consensus subnetworks are enriched for inactivating mutations ( < 0.0001) or mutation clusters ( < 0.0001) compared to genes not in subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 6–18 [href=this file] and Supplementary Note Section 5.1 [href=#SD1] ). Finally, we evaluated a subset of the mutations in these genes using RNA-Seq and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the same samples, and found RNA-Seq and/or WGS reads that validated 39 mutations in these novel genes ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 23 [href=this file] ).
Multiple pairs of genes within these subnetworks show co-occurring mutations ( Supplementary Table 24 [href=this file] ). We observe significant mutual exclusivity within 4 of our subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 25 [href=this file] ).
The three largest subnetworks – including a subnetwork, a subnetwork, and a subnetwork – contain many well-known cancer genes ( Supplementary Tables 8–10 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figures 16,17 [href=#SD1] ).
HotNet2 Pan-Cancer analyses also revealed a number of novel genes ( Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] ) within these three subnetworks.
The sixth most mutated HotNet2 Pan-Cancer subnetwork (16.8% of samples) includes multiple members of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex ( Figure 3a [href=#F3] and Supplementary Table 12 [href=this file] ).
Another HotNet2 Pan-Cancer subnetwork (mutated in 7.1% of samples) overlaps the BAP1 complex ( Figure 3b [href=#F3] and Supplementary Table 13 [href=this file] ).
HotNet2 Pan-Cancer analysis identifies 4/5 members of the cohesin complex as a significantly mutated subnetwork (7.3% of samples, Figure 4a [href=#F4] and Supplementary Table 15 [href=this file] ).
The combined subnetwork is mutated in 4.2% of samples ( Figure 4b [href=#F4] and Supplementary Table 6 [href=this file] ). Finally, RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing data from the same samples provide further validation of the somatic mutations in , , , , , and and show that some of these mutations are expressed ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 39 [href=this file] ).
Some of these rarely mutated genes are inevitably false positive predictions of the analysis, but many (including , , , , , and others) exhibit either mutational clustering or protein interactions that support a role for the observed somatic aberrations ( Supplementary Tables 6–18 [href=this file] ).
Our analysis complements other recent Pan-Cancer analyses including studies that analyze only one type of aberration or restrict attention to recurrent aberrations ( Supplementary Note Section 8.3 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 27 [href=this file] ).
The statistical test is the same as the two-stage statistical test introduced in the original HotNet algorithm ( Supplementary Note Section 1.3 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figures 20–23 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 28 [href=this file] ).
HotNet2 has two parameters β and δ, and selects values for both of these parameters using procedures. β is selected from the protein-protein interaction network, of any gene scores ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.1 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figure 24 [href=#SD1] , and Supplementary Table 29 [href=this file] ). We evaluated the sensitivity of the HotNet2 results to the value of β and found that varying β ±10% has only a minor effect on the results, with at most 7 genes (3.8% of total) added/removed from the subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 28 [href=this file] ). The value of δ is chosen such that large connected components are not found using the observed gene score distribution on random networks with the same degree distribution as the observed network ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.2 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figure 25 [href=#SD1] , and Supplementary Table 30 [href=this file] ). We evaluated the sensitivity of the HotNet2 results to the value of δ, and found that varying δ ±5% changed at most 35 genes (12.3% of total) in the subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 29 [href=this file] ).
We found that HotNet2 returns >80% fewer hot stars/spiders than HotNet on the Pan-Cancer datasets ( Supplementary Table 31 [href=this file] ). This is a major difference between the algorithms and is one of the reasons why HotNet fails to find statistically significant results ( ≤ 0.01 for any subnetwork size ) on three of six runs ( Supplementary Table 32,33 [href=this file] ), while HotNet2 finds statistically significant results on all six runs.
We also show that HotNet2 has much higher specificity than HotNet, DAVID, and GSEA in identifying genes satisfying the 20/20 rule ( Supplementary Note Section 8.1.4 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figure 27 [href=#SD1] , and Supplementary Tables 34–36 [href=this file] ).
Most of the subnetworks (12/14) identified by HotNet2 were also found when we remove the requirement for RNA-Seq expression ( Supplementary Table 37 [href=this file] ). Notable among the additional subnetworks identified when we remove the requirement for RNA-Seq expression is a subnetwork ( Supplementary Table 25 [href=this file] ) containing members of the telomerase complex (including and ) that has a well-studied role in cancer ( Supplementary Figure 30 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 38 [href=this file] ). We found only minor differences in the HotNet2 subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 39 [href=this file] ), demonstrating that our reported subnetworks are altered by somatic aberrations in these samples.",xlsx,Pan-Cancer Network Analysis Identifies Combinations of Rare Somatic Mutations across Pathways and Protein Complexes - PMC,"(365KB, xlsx)",media p,/articles/instance/4444046/bin/NIHMS644198-supplement-2.xlsx,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

To avoid any substantial bias due to non-tumor cell contamination, a stringent purity threshold was determined by applying Wilcoxon test, for which the degree of contamination of claudin-low tumors was not statistically different from that of non-claudin-low tumors, thus enabling a comparable distribution of tumors (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). Demonstrating an unexpected degree of diversity, only 35.6% of these tumors were classified as TNBCs (Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] ). This result was not due to the purity selection, as the percentage of TNBCs within all claudin-low tumors was similar before applying the purity threshold (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). 
Only 17.8% were found in cluster 10, whereas 48.8% and 17.8% were found in integrative clusters 4 and 3, respectively, regardless of tumor purity when compared with non-claudin-low tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). After having previously removed germline copy number variations (CNVs), we analyzed B allele frequency (BAF) and log R ratio (LRR) profiles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localized in genomic regions of deletion (LRR segment mean cutoff value < −0.4) (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 3a, c [this file] ). Consistent with these data, the analysis of somatic mutations highlighted the presence of several point mutations with a variant allele frequency higher than 0.4 (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). 
Of note, although these analyses were performed on tumors selected for their high tumor purity, similar data were obtained when studying the whole cohort of claudin-low tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ), further strengthening the characterization of the three claudin-low subgroups. 
Of note, global gene expression signatures demonstrated that the CL2 and CL3 subgroups showed lower luminal- and basal-related signature scores, respectively, compared with luminal- and basal-like breast tumors, while exhibiting a significant enrichment in invasiveness-related signatures (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b [this file] ). 
A claudin-low gene list of 137 genes discriminating the 3 claudin-low subgroups was thus created (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ). This expression-based classifier showed an accuracy of 91% when compared with the FGA-based classification using Gaussian finite mixture models (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d [this file] ). Validating the accuracy of our classifier, CL1, CL2, and CL3 tumors and cell lines showed low, moderate, and elevated FGA levels, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6e, f [this file] ). Of note, we performed a pathway analysis of CL1 discriminant genes that revealed an enrichment in stem cell and pediatric cancer markers (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). 
Differentially methylated gene analysis was next performed in claudin-low subgroups followed by pathway-enrichment analysis, using over 15,000 pathways available in MSigDB (HALLMARKS, C2, and C5 gene sets) (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). The CL1 subgroup had the highest score for stemness- ( , ) and EMT- (mesenchymal markers: , , ; epithelial markers: , ) related genes, whereas CL2 and CL3 displayed an intermediate score compared with CL1 tumors and with their relative luminal/basal counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
CL1 tumors mainly display hypomethylated genes that are related to a stemness phenotype, CL2 tumors are overall hypermethylated for genes associated with basal-like features, and CL3 tumors show more heterogeneous methylation profiles with both hypermethylated genes (linked to luminal phenotype) and hypomethylated genes (relative to basal-like characteristics) (see Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] for methodology). 
Additional gene expression analyses performed on METABRIC and TCGA cohorts using two different cellular signature deconvolution algorithms confirmed that these tumors were highly infiltrated by immune cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d [this file] ). Nevertheless, unsupervised clustering of microenvironment signatures (immune and non-immune cell subsets) did not allow to discriminate the different claudin-low subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 9e–h [this file] ). 
Supporting our previous results, CL2 and CL3 showed, among the three claudin-low subgroups, the highest score for luminal- (estrogen-related response) and basal-related (proliferation and DDR) signatures, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ). Furthermore, both CL2 and CL3 showed an activation of the EMT process (Fig. 6a, b, g [rid=Fig6] ), coherent with the downregulation of hormone (in CL2) and proliferation/DDR (in CL3) signatures, compared with luminal and basal tumors, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] and Fig. 6g [rid=Fig6] ). Moreover, CL1 displayed a low proliferation activity and a low DDR (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b, e, f [this file] ), as well as a strong TP53 signaling pathway signature associated with a low frequency of mutations (Fig. 6c, d, g [rid=Fig6] ). 
When stratified by CL subgroups, variations in survival outcome were found, consistent with their presumed origin (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
These traits include (i) a high expression of the ZEB1 EMT-inducing transcription factor and of its target, the methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB3; (ii) a frequent activation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway; (iii) a low activation of the DDR; and (iv) a low frequency of mutations (Supplementary Figs. 8 [this file] and 10 [this file] , and Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] ). 
The use of a high-purity threshold for tumor selection allowed to circumvent the contamination bias related to the tumor-related centroid (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
Finally, the nearest shrunken centroid classifier encompassed 137 genes whose expression discriminate the three FGA-related claudin-low subgroups in METABRIC cohort (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
As previously described for genome-wide expression–methylation quantitative trait loci analysis , genes for which methylation -values were negatively correlated with expression values (Spearman’s < 0 and FDR -value < 0.05) were selected for differential methylation analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ).",pdf,Comprehensive characterization of claudin-low breast tumors reflects the impact of the cell-of-origin on cancer evolution,,,,,,,

This analysis revealed widespread differences in APA, identifying 628 differential APA (dAPA) events ( Fig. 3c [rid=F3] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ) that resulted from an increased usage of either the distal or the proximal PAS to similar degree (14.29% of all genes with more than 1 polyadenylation site). 
Consistent with the observations in iNs, this analysis confirmed widespread dAPA in postmortem PFC from ISCZ ( Fig. 3e [rid=F3] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ) as well as substantial overlap with dAPA in iNs ( Fig. 3f [rid=F3] ). 
Strikingly, genes subject to dAPA in ISCZ were strongly enriched for synapse related processes such as glutamatergic neurotransmission, synaptic membrane components, synaptic plasticity or vesicle biology in both iNs and human PFC ( Fig. 4a [rid=F4] , b [rid=F4] , and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
RBP motif analysis in the UTRs of transcripts subject to dAPA identified numerous expressed RBPs with critical roles for neuronal biology such as QKI, ELAVL and RBM proteins ( Fig. 5c [rid=F5] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Similarly, we also corrected the R values for gender, batch and TechnicalPC1 using beta regression and used the residuals to compute the average difference in R values between the groups (ΔAPA, Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ).
