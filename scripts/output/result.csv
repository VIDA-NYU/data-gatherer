Increasing the total liposome concentration caused the majority of PLIN3 to bind membranes, but 5% of PLIN3 remained in the soluble fraction (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). DLS characterization indicated DAG enriched liposomes had two populations based on size (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] , d [this file] ), which is likely due to the fusogenic properties of DAG . The addition of DOPA or PLIN3 protein decreased or eliminated the population of the larger (>400 nm) liposomes (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] , d [this file] ). 
ALDs with 80 mol% DOPC and 20 mol% DOPE showed 50% binding of PLIN3 (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ). 
In the presence of membranes, striking differences in deuterium exchange were observed throughout the PLIN3 sequence (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Notably, many of the peptides with the PAT domain and 11-mer repeats displayed a bimodal distribution of deuterium exchange upon membrane binding (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] , b [this file] ). 
The protection from deuterium exchange and the non-gaussian bimodal distribution for most peptides in the PAT domain persisted over a longer time course (~300 sec) in comparison to peptides within the 11-mer repeat regions (~30 sec) (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). 
In contrast to the N-terminal PAT domain and 11-mer repeats, the C-terminal 4-helix bundle displayed a large increase in deuterium exchange (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). 
In line with of previous HDX-MS and liposome sedimentation experiments, we observed protection from H-D exchange in the PAT domain and 11-mer repeats using 4ME-PC/PE and DOPC/PE/DAG liposomes, with the magnitude and duration of H-D exchange protection in these regions correlating with the observed fraction of PLIN3 bound in liposome sedimentation assays (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] , Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] d, g [rid=Fig1] ). 
We first sought to confirm the effects of liposome binding on the secondary structure of PLIN3 by circular dichroism (CD) (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
We do however see from continuous wave (CW) ESR of 37C/114C (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ) that there might be a sizeable fraction of spins in the 15-20 Å range whose contribution to the distance distribution will be significantly attenuated since DEER has low sensitivity to distances in this range. 
Interestingly, constructs containing only the PAT domain (residues 1–116) or only the 11-mer repeats (residues 114–204), which bound to DEVs in a DAG-dependent manner, remained cytoplasmic under all conditions (Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] d, e [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ).

S1–S7  and  Tables  S1  and  S2,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"SARS-CoV-2-reactive CD4 T cells were detected based on the upregulation of CD154 (CD40L) after 7 h stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) with overlapping peptide pools of the different proteins and subsequent magnetic enrichment (antigen-reactive T cell enrichment [ARTE]) ( Bacher et al., 2016 [rid=bib5] ; Bacher et al., 2019 [rid=bib6] ) ( Figure S1 [this file] A). SARS-CoV-2 exposure versus non-exposure of blood donors was verified by SARS-CoV-2 PCR and/or serology testing ( Tables S1 [this file] and S2 [this file] ). 
The specificity of the SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells in unexposed as well as exposed donors was confirmed by reactivity of expanded CD154 T cells toward SARS-CoV-2, but not control antigens ( Figures S1 [this file] B and S1C). 
In particular, Tfh-like, transitional, and central memory T cells showed a related profile with variable gene expression of , , , , and ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] B, S2 [this file] A, and S2B). Similar clusters were also identified in SARS-CoV-2-reactive memory T cells from unexposed individuals, and we were not able to clearly separate unexposed donors from COVID-19 patients or between patients with different disease severity only based on qualitative differences of the reactive T cells ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] C and S2 [this file] B). 
Increased expression of the acute and chronic activation markers Ki-67 and CD38 was confirmed by flow cytometry ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] D and S3 [this file] A) and declined with time after infection ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] E), in contrast to the frequencies of reactive T cells ( Figure S3 [this file] B). Relative, but especially absolute amounts of inflammatory cytokines were increased in COVID-19, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2), IFN-γ and IL-21, compared with those in unexposed individuals ( Figures S3 [this file] C and S3D). Whereas inflammatory cytokines increased with time after infection, IL-10 was mainly produced during active disease ( Figure S3 [this file] E). We observed no differences in the cytokine response or phenotype between the individual SARS-CoV-2 proteins ( Figure S4 [this file] ). 
A substantial fraction of SARS-CoV-2-reactive cells from unexposed donors but not COVID-19 patients displayed a naive phenotype, as evidenced by expression of CD45RA, CCR7, and CD27 and lack of CD45RO, CD95, and CD11a ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] A, 3B, and S5 [this file] A). 
A similar tendency was also seen for the absolute frequencies of pre-existing memory T cells among CD4 T cells ( Figure S5 [this file] B). In contrast, we detected no correlation of pre-existing T cell frequency with donor age ( Figure S5 [this file] C). A comparable correlation with the total CD4 memory compartment was observed for pre-existing CMV-reactive memory T cells from CMV-sero-negative donors ( Figure 3 [rid=fig3] E), as well as for memory T cells reactive against the neoantigen keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) ( Figure S5 [this file] D). 
In line with that, CCCoV-spike-reactive T cells showed higher production of the inflammatory cytokines IFN-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), IL-2, and IL-21 than in SARS-CoV-2-spike-reactive T cells from unexposed individuals ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] G, 4H, and S4 [this file] ). 
Only a weak correlation was observed between SARS-CoV-2 memory T cells and individual CCCoV strains ( Figure 5 [rid=fig5] D), which was similar to other common viral antigens ( Figure S6 [this file] ). 
Classification was based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, whereby WHO groups 3–5 (moderate) and 6–7 (severe) were combined to increase statistical power (see Table S1 [this file] ). The increased frequencies in severe disease were not due to an age bias as shown for a selected group of donors in the age range of 50–65 years ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] B, 6C, and S7 [this file] ). 
The COVID-19 severity level was assessed on the basis of WHO criteria, whereby WHO groups 3–5 (moderate) and 6 and 7 (severe) were combined to increase statistical power (see Table S1 [this file] ). 
Peripheral EDTA blood samples were collected between April and September 2020 from 56 COVID-19 patients and from 64 in-house volunteers as unexposed controls (see Tables S1 [this file] and S2 [this file] for further details). 51 of 56 COVID-19 patients were tested positive and for SARS-CoV-2 RNA.",pdf,Low-Avidity CD4,XML,,,,,,,

Transcriptomic analysis indicated the upregulation of genes for tryptophan synthesis (ZMO0584-7, which forms an operon with two other genes of ZMO0582 and ZMO0583), however; when all variables were taken into consideration together the changes were less than the cutoff value of at least 2 fold (Table S7, Table S13 in file S2 [this file] ). 
We identified 942 proteins, which is about 55% of the total predicted ZM4 proteins (Table S6 in file S2 [this file]. This is the largest number of expressed proteins described for to date (Table S2, Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). 
We identified 95 differentially detected proteins based on a comparison of spectrum count values (i.e., the number of tandem mass spectra that identify tryptic peptides of a particular protein) [52] [rid=pone.0068886-Hendrickson1] , [53] [rid=pone.0068886-Zhang3] , [54] [rid=pone.0068886-Cooper1] , of which 84 had at least a 1.5-fold change and 61 had a 2-fold or higher difference ( Table 1 [rid=pone-0068886-t001] and Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). Two differentially detected proteins (ZMO0593 and ZMO0734) contain peptides that also could be assigned to other proteins; Table S3 in file S2 [this file] lists the 30 identified proteins that contain non-unique peptides. We identified 53 up-regulated proteins and 31 down-regulated proteins for the ethanol treatment at exponential phase compared to the untreated control in the same growth phase at the 1.5-fold cutoff (Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ), and these were sub-grouped by their COG (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) functional categories [60] [rid=pone.0068886-Tatusov1] separately ( Fig. 2 [rid=pone-0068886-g002] and Table S6 in file S2 [this file]. About one-third of the up-regulated proteins are within the metabolism category, and most are related to energy production/conversion, as well as nucleotide transport proteins ( Fig. 2 [rid=pone-0068886-g002] and Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). Among the 31 ethanol down-regulated proteins with at least 1.5-fold change, ribosomal proteins as well as proteins involved in flagellar synthesis and DNA replication have been shown to interact with each other ( Fig. 3A [rid=pone-0068886-g003] and Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). The 53 ethanol up-regulated proteins with at least 1.5-fold change had fewer interactions; chaperone proteins, DNA and protein repair proteins, as well as alcohol dehydrogenase and proteins involved in the ED pathway and energy metabolism showed stronger linkages than the rest of the ethanol up-regulated proteins ( Fig. 3A [rid=pone-0068886-g003] and Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). 
Among proteins with highest normalized spectrum counts, and therefore likely to be abundant [61] [rid=pone.0068886-Liu1] , were ribosomal proteins, enzymes involved in the ED pathway, and chaperones (Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). Enzymes that were abundant in both the ethanol-treated and control conditions included key enzymes such as pyruvate kinase (Pyk, ZMO0152), phosphopyruvate hydratase (Eno, ZMO1608), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (Gap, ZMO0177); as well as proteins like chaperone DnaK (ZMO0660) and chaperonin GroEL (ZMO1929)(Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). 
In the absence of any fold-change filtering, about seventeen hundred genes were identified to be significantly differentially expressed using the ANOVA with treatment and time as variables (Table S7 in file S2 [this file] ), covering nearly all of the ZM4 genes reannotated by our group [14] [rid=pone.0068886-Yang1] indicating a dynamic gene expression for ethanol responses. 
By comparing gene expression between ethanol-treated and control cells at the same growth phase, 483 genes were significant with at least a 2-fold change (Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S8 in file S2 [this file] ). The majority of differentially expressed genes responded to the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase (Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S8 in file S2 [this file] ). Similar to proteomic data ( Table 1 [rid=pone-0068886-t001] ), ethanol treatment repressed the expression of genes related to the function of information storage and processing, with more genes associated with cellular processes being up-regulated in response to the treatment (Table S8 in file S2 [this file] ). Five genes were constitutively down-regulated with the ethanol treatment, which are a subfamily IA HAD-superfamily hydrolase (ZMO1862), Beta-fructofuranosidase (ZMO0375), exodeoxyribonuclease III Xth (ZMO1699), DNA primase (ZMO1622), and a hypothetical protein (ZMO0930) (Table S8 in file S2 [this file] ). Only two genes were constitutively ethanol upregulated, namely a putative oxidoreductase (ZMO0101) and an YceI family protein (ZMO1334) (Table S8 in file S2 [this file] ). 
With a cut-off value of at least a 2-fold change, a time series comparison identified 571 genes significantly expressed in ethanol-treated cells (Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S9 in file S2 [this file] ). 112 genes were identified to be related to ethanol stress but not growth phase (Table S10 in file S2 [this file] ). The time series gene expression of ethanol-treated cells had a different pattern of functional categories from the treatment versus control comparison, with more genes related to cellular processes down-regulated and more genes associated with metabolism and information storage and processing up-regulated (Table S10 in file S2 [this file] ). 
Thirty-four genes were identified to be ethanol-induced in both the comparison of ethanol-treated to control and time series ethanol responsive genes (Table S11 in file S2 [this file] ). In addition, responded to ethanol stress primarily by repressing the gene expression at an early stage such as the exponential phase treatment and control comparison and the time-series study of the treated-cells from 6 h to 10 h (Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] ; Table S9, Table S10 in file S2 [this file] ). For example, 32 genes were down-regulated comparing the treated to the control cells during the exponential phase, which was twice as many as the up-regulated ones (Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S9 in file S2 [this file] ). Time series studies of the ethanol-treated cells’ response from 6 h to 10 h also identified 19 genes down-regulated compared to 2 up-regulated ones only (Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S10 in file S2 [this file] ). 
Among the twelve hopanoid biosynthesis proteins identified by proteomic study, none were significantly different between the treatment and control conditions (Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). 
Nine hundred and twenty five proteins identified by proteomic study also yielded corresponding gene-expression data, which formed 925 gene-protein pairs (Table S6, Table S7 in file S2 [this file] ). At the same exponential phase as used in the proteomic study, 500 genes were found to be significantly expressed based on JMP Genomics analysis out of the total 925 genes from all the conditions (Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). The number of significantly expressed genes was more than that of the 95 significantly expressed proteins by the G-test analysis ( Table 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ), which is likely due to technical differences between the proteomic and transcriptomic techniques and analyses. Only one protein out of the 95 significantly expressed proteins had no corresponding gene expression data, and there is a correlation coefficient R-squared value (R ) of 0.33 between these 94 gene-protein pairs ( Table 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [rid=pone.0068886.s005] , Table S6 in file S2 [this file] ). 
We identified nine examples where gene expression and protein levels changed in opposite directions, likely pointing to differences in regulation between transcripts and proteins (Table S12 in file S2 [this file] ). Other example includes six genes such as heat shock protein DnaJ domain-containing gene (ZMO1690), protease ClpA gene (ZMO0405), short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase SDR gene (ZMO0318), alcohol dehydrogenase (ZMO1236) etc., which had a reduced gene expression (ca 1.6-fold to more than 2-fold change) but an increased protein expression (ca 1.6- to more than 8-fold change) levels with the ethanol treatment (Table S12 in file S2 [this file] ). 
The new operon predictions consist of 366 multi-gene transcripts and 651 single-gene transcripts (Table S13 in file S2 [this file] ). 
Differences between ethanol-treated cells and control cells were largely due to growth differences (Table S7 in file S2 [this file] ). 
In this study, we updated operon predictions for and this may aid future metabolic engineering endeavors (Table S13 in file S2 [this file] ), just as a prior study joined two genes into the gene for increased tolerance to sodium acetate when over-expressed [22] [rid=pone.0068886-Yang2] .",xlsx,Systems Biology Analysis of,XML,,,,,,,

While the addition of supplemental tryptophan did not appear to have an effect on ethanol tolerance (data not shown), medium supplementation with glycerol at low concentrations (0.001%) improved growth marginally as it entered stationary phase under ethanol stress conditions on a consistent basis but not at levels considered significant in this study (Fig. S2 in file S5 [this file] ). 
The isoelectric point and molecular mass distributions for the identified proteins were similar to the corresponding distributions for all proteins in the revised genome annotation of[14] [rid=pone.0068886-Yang1] (Fig. S3 in file S5 [this file] ). 
The correlation coefficients for microarray data from biological replicates were good, with r >0.98 for each comparison (Fig. S4A in file S5 [this file] ). In addition, the microarray data of biological replicates were also grouped together closely based on the hierarchical clustering and principal components analyses (Fig. S4B–C in file S5 [this file] ), and that data can be grouped or separated as time points advance through the experiment and also by treatment before the application of the ANOVA testing. 
Two comparisons were then carried out to identify the ethanol-responsive genes, by comparing the significant genes between the ethanol-treated cells and the control cells at different growth phases, as well as by comparing the time series of differentially expressed genes within ethanol-treated cells (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] ). Differentially expressed genes identified from both the treatment versus control study and the ethanol-treatment time series study but not from the control time series study were regarded as ethanol-responsive genes (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] ). 
By comparing gene expression between ethanol-treated and control cells at the same growth phase, 483 genes were significant with at least a 2-fold change (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S8 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). The majority of differentially expressed genes responded to the transition from exponential phase to stationary phase (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S8 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). 
With a cut-off value of at least a 2-fold change, a time series comparison identified 571 genes significantly expressed in ethanol-treated cells (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S9 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). 112 genes were identified to be related to ethanol stress but not growth phase (Table S10 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). 
In addition, responded to ethanol stress primarily by repressing the gene expression at an early stage such as the exponential phase treatment and control comparison and the time-series study of the treated-cells from 6 h to 10 h (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] ; Table S9, Table S10 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). For example, 32 genes were down-regulated comparing the treated to the control cells during the exponential phase, which was twice as many as the up-regulated ones (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S9 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). Time series studies of the ethanol-treated cells’ response from 6 h to 10 h also identified 19 genes down-regulated compared to 2 up-regulated ones only (Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S10 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). 
The number of significantly expressed genes was more than that of the 95 significantly expressed proteins by the G-test analysis ( Table 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S6 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ), which is likely due to technical differences between the proteomic and transcriptomic techniques and analyses. Only one protein out of the 95 significantly expressed proteins had no corresponding gene expression data, and there is a correlation coefficient R-squared value (R ) of 0.33 between these 94 gene-protein pairs ( Table 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] , Table S6 in file S2 [rid=pone.0068886.s002] ). We can also see a better correlation between proteomic and transcriptomic data for the significantly differentially expressed gene-protein pairs with increasing gene expression differences ( Table 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] ). For example, when we selected the significantly expressed proteins with at least 1.5 or 2-fold change and then compared their correlations to their corresponding genes with significant gene expression, the R values are 0.49 (49 protein-gene pairs) or 0.50 (40 protein-gene pairs) respectively ( Table 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] ). 
In growth studies the addition of glycerol to the medium appeared to have a marginal effect on ethanol stress (Fig. S2 in file S5 [this file] ). 
We observe better correlations between proteomic and transcriptomic data for the significantly differentially expressed gene-protein pairs with increasing gene expression differences ( Table 1 [rid=pone-0068886-t001] , 2 [rid=pone-0068886-t002] , Fig. S5 in file S5 [this file] ).",docx,Systems Biology Analysis of,XML,,,,,,,

Two microgram of total RNA was reverse‐transcribed using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio‐Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was diluted five times with water, and 2 μL was used as a template for quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis using primers as shown in Table S1 [this file] . ( ) was used as an internal control for normalization. 
For export, an ion‐cutoff of 20 was chosen (exported peptide measurements: Data S9 [this file] ). Technical outliers were identified using correlation analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) of protein abundance data implemented by an R script (Data S5 [this file] ). The average Pearson correlation coefficient of each GI‐TAP replicate with the other replicates of the same time point was above 95% for all GI‐3F6H samples apart from sample 19E (Fig. S2 [this file] ), which was also clearly separated from all other samples by PCA and was therefore discarded. 
A custom R script performed further statistical analysis and plotting (Data S7 [this file] ). To assess rhythmicity, we used the JTK_CYCLE tool 53 [rid=feb213311-bib-0053] to analyze periods of 22–26 h (Data S8 [this file] ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed using ( http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R (http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R) , version: 2.16.0, 55 [rid=feb213311-bib-0055] , 56 [rid=feb213311-bib-0056] , using a node size of 3, as described by 57 [rid=feb213311-bib-0057] (Data S6 [this file] ). 
Full‐length coding sequence was PCR‐amplified using cDNA as template with primers shown in Table S1 [this file] , cloned into pENTR/D‐TOPO (Invitrogen) and sequence‐verified. 
As a first experiment, we performed a preliminary study where we used TAP of GI‐3F6H followed by silver‐staining of a protein gel separation and LC‐MS of excised gel bands (Fig. 1 [rid=feb213311-fig-0001] F, Fig. S1 [this file] , Data S1 [this file] ). Our GI‐3F6H line expressed sufficient GI protein for effective TAP and analysis of gel bands by MS identified GI and known interactors (Fig. S1 [this file] , Data S1 [this file] ). 
In order to exclude known nonspecific interactors, we eliminated all proteins from our list that were previously reported to be purified by GFP‐3F6H with the same sample preparation protocol 48 [rid=feb213311-bib-0048] (Data S3 [this file] ). Therefore, we also excluded proteins from further analyses that are located in the chloroplast or mitochondria but not in the cytoplasm or nucleus according to their GO annotation 63 [rid=feb213311-bib-0063] (Table 1 [rid=feb213311-tbl-0001] ; full results in Data S2 [this file] ). 
After identification and quantification of proteins (Fig. 2 [rid=feb213311-fig-0002] C), one outlier (GI‐3F6H sample at ZT19, replicate E) was excluded from subsequent analysis (see Experimental Procedures; Fig. S2 [this file] ). 
In order to exclude known unspecific interactors, we used the same strategy as for the qualitative study, eliminating 80 proteins previously purified by GFP‐3F6H 48 [rid=feb213311-bib-0048] and 169 chloroplast and mitochondrial proteins 63 [rid=feb213311-bib-0063] (Data S3 [this file] , S4 [this file] and S6 [this file] ). Subsequent analysis used raw abundance data exported from Progenesis as opposed to the abundance which is normalized by the sum of all intensities of ions with the chosen inclusion criteria (see Materials and methods [rid=feb213311-sec-0003] ) in each mass spectrometric analysis; however, analysis of normalized data gave very similar results (data not shown and Data S3 [this file] ). 
The raw data of the Progenesis output file and the raw data after removing likely unspecific proteins (GFP interacting proteins 48 [rid=feb213311-bib-0048] ) and plastid or mitochondrial proteins, (see Data S3 [this file] ) was used for statistics 
Among these 88 proteins, 13 changed significantly in abundance within the time series (assessed for any change by ANOVA, ‐value < 0.05) or 10 as assessed for rhythmic profiles (by JTK_CYCLE ‐value < 0.05; Table 2 [rid=feb213311-tbl-0002] and Data S3 [this file] ; Data S8 [this file] ). 
GO terms related to protein degradation were overrepresented among the candidates, as well as light response related terms, some metabolic processes, and flower development (Data S4 [this file] and S6 [this file] ). 
The direct interactors FKF1, ZTL, and LKP2 showed temporal profiles consistent with their mRNA expression patterns 65 [rid=feb213311-bib-0065] , 66 [rid=feb213311-bib-0066] , 67 [rid=feb213311-bib-0067] , 68 [rid=feb213311-bib-0068] (Fig. S3 [this file] ). 
The abundant, plastid‐localized proteins enriched as interactors (Data S3 [this file] and S4 [this file] ) likely reflect unspecific binding, at least in the case of chloroplast‐encoded proteins, which was an expected cost of detecting low‐abundance and indirect interactors. Conservatively, we excluded mitochondrial and chloroplast proteins (see Materials and methods [rid=feb213311-sec-0003] ; Data S3 [this file] ) from the candidate interactors (Tables 1 [rid=feb213311-tbl-0001] and 3 [rid=feb213311-tbl-0003] ).",zip,Time‐resolved interaction proteomics of the,XML,,,,,,,

Total cysteine-glycine synthesised from glutathione catabolism by GGT was also increased in liver ( Figure S2H [this file] ), although free cysteine-glycine was unchanged ( Figure S2I [this file] ). mice ( 4 [rid=R4] ) and patients with ASA ( 26 [rid=R26] , 27 [rid=R27] ) may present chronic kidney disease and renal failure. Supporting this, urine glutathione concentrations were significantly increased in mice compared to WT, suggesting defective renal glutathione reabsorption ( Figure S2J [this file] ). Urine cysteine concentrations were also significantly increased in mice compared to WT ( Figures S2K [this file] ), in line with an elevation of these metabolites in the plasma and livers, a consequence which is partially explained by increased GGT activity. Urine cysteine-glycine concentrations, however, were not significantly increased ( Figure S2L [this file] ). 
Here the liver GSH:GSSG ratio did not differ between and WT littermates ( Figure S2M [this file] ), indicating that the reduction of total glutathione pool in mice was not associated with increased glutathione oxidation. 
The steady-state concentration of the oxidative breakdown products of NO, nitrite (NO ) and nitrate (NO ), were significantly lower in plasma ( Figure S2N [this file] ) and liver ( Figure 1M [rid=F1] ), as previously reported in this disorder ( 4 [rid=R4] , 5 [rid=R5] ). Nitroso-species showed no difference between livers versus WT, and did not support NO deficiency as a critical pathophysiological mechanism in the liver ( Figure S2O [this file] ). The lack of difference in nitrotyrosine concentrations by western blot in livers versus WT confirmed the absence of nitro-oxidative stress ( Figure 1N [rid=F1] , Figure S2P [this file] ). Nrf2 protein abundances did not differ between WT and livers ( Figure S2Q [this file] ). 
Supporting this, untargeted proteomics comparing WT and livers highlighted glutathione function as downregulated ( Figure 1R [rid=F1] , Figure S3A-C [this file] ). 
Conversely, it was challenging to distinguish between pancreatic and liver [ F]FSPG retention in mice ( Figures 2B, 2C [rid=F2] , Figure S4A [this file] ). High [ F]FSPG retention was also present in the skin of mice (13 ± 1.8% ID/g) which was not the case in WT littermates (5.3 ± 2.3% ID/g; Figure 2B, 2E [rid=F2] ; =0.002; Figure S4B [this file] ). 
S5A, B [this file] ) and activity ( fig. S5C [this file] ) in ASL-deficient fibroblasts from patients with ASA compared to a mRNA control lipid nanoparticle. mRNA therapy has transient efficacy and requires re-administration to enable a sustained effect. No effect on arginine concentrations was observed ( Figure S6A [this file] ). Western blot and immunohistochemistry data in liver showed restored ASL protein abundance at physiological levels at 24h post-administration of mRNA ( Figures 3F-I [rid=F3] , Figure S6B-D [this file] ). 
This twice higher dose was based on liver biodistribution between IV and IP routes, which showed that a two-fold higher IP dose has a similar liver biodistribution as a single IV dose ( Figures S7A, 7B [this file] ). The macroscopic phenotype of mice was restored to that of WT littermates in the mRNA treatment group, with normalisation of survival ( Figure 4B [rid=F4] , =0.002), growth ( Figure 4C [rid=F4] , Figure S8A [this file] ), fur ( Figure 4D [rid=F4] ), and hepatomegaly ( Figure S8B [this file] ). 
No significant differences in arginine concentrations in dried blood spots between WT or mRNA- or mRNA-treated mice were observed ( Figure S8C [this file] ). Elevated plasma amino transferase (ALT) was normalized in the mRNA-treated mice ( Figure S8D [this file] ). Longitudinal analysis of plasma ammonia ( Figure S8E [this file] ), argininosuccinic acid, ( Figure S8F [this file] ), and citrulline ( Figure S8G [this file] ) concentrations in dried blood spots, and urinary orotate concentrations ( Figure S8H [this file] ) in mRNA-treated mice showed sustained therapeutic benefit over time. Gender analysis showed that there were no sex-related differences in the different efficacy endpoints in the mRNA-treated group ( Table S3 [this file] ). 
In contrast, mRNA-treated mice only survived up to day 37 of life, with most animals dying before day 30 ( Figure 5B [rid=F5] , =0.002). mRNA-treated mice showed significantly improved growth compared to mRNA littermates, however the body weight remained significantly lower than WT littermates ( Figure 5C [rid=F5] , Figure S9A [this file] ). Liver to body weight ratio remained significantly elevated in both treated mice groups ( Figure S9B [this file] ). There were no significant differences in arginine concentrations between WT, mRNA and mRNA-treated groups ( Figure S9C [this file] ). ALT concentrations indicated an absence of liver toxicity in the mRNA-treated mice compared to WT littermates ( Figure S9D [this file] ). Gender analysis could not determine any sex differences between the different efficacy endpoints in the mRNA-treated group ( Figure S10 and Table S4 [this file] ). 
Supporting our functional and metabolic data, [ F]FSPG retention was halved in mRNA-treated (11 ± 2.0% ID/g) versus untreated mice (22 ± 2.3% ID/g; = 0.026; Figure 6A, 6B [rid=F6] , Figure S11A [this file] ). Conversely, skin [ F]FSPG retention was not affected by mRNA therapy. [ F]FSPG skin retention was 4.2 ± 3.4% ID/g in WT mice, compared to 15 ± 3.7% ID/g and 15 ± 4.2% ID/g in untreated and mRNA treated mice, respectively ( Figures S11B, S11C [this file] ). 
No pathway correlation was observed between these genes, which had different localisation and function ( Table S5 [this file] ). 
This suggests that the normalisation of ASL expression corrects hepatic glutathione metabolism by restoring the NO availability and thereby GCL upregulation ( Figure S12 [this file] ).

We observed increased numbers of RASSF1C‐expressing cells that exhibited rounded morphology in 3D collagen matrix in mesenchymal (MDA‐MB‐231) (Fig 1B [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] , bottom) and also in epithelial (MCF7 from 80% of epithelial‐polygonal to 85% rounded morphology and H1299 from 81% epithelial‐polygonal to 88% rounded shape) cell lines (Fig 1B [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] top, Appendix Fig S1 [this file] B and C), suggesting that RASSF1C may be involved not only in mesenchymal‐amoeboid but also in epithelial‐amoeboid transition (EAT). However, while control cells maintained a typically elongated, fibroblast‐like, shape, cells transfected with RASSF1C showed rounded morphology (Appendix Fig S1 [this file] D). 
We detected increased activity of MMP‐9 metalloprotease in control MDA‐MB‐231 cells compared to cells expressing RASSF1C (Fig 1E [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] , Appendix Fig S1 [this file] E for quantification). To further investigate this, we performed an invasion assay using hydrogel matrix, which is not degradable by metalloproteases (Fig 1F [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] , right bar graph, and Appendix Fig S1 [this file] F). Using ROCK (Y27632) and Rho (C3) inhibitors, we could demonstrate that Matrigel invasion by ZsRASSF1C‐expressing MDA‐MB‐231 cells was greatly impaired by both inhibitors, thus demonstrating Rho/ROCK dependency (Fig 1G [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] and Appendix Fig S1 [this file] G). However, the treatment of control cells with both drugs resulted in no effect on their ability to invade (Fig 1G [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] and Appendix Fig S1 [this file] G). To further support Rho/ROCK dependency, we could show that expression of ZsRASSF1C and a dominant‐negative RhoA derivative (RhoA‐DN) suppressed ZsRASSF1C‐driven invasion in both MDA‐MB‐231 and MCF7, while a catalytically active RhoA derivative (RhoA‐CA) enhanced invasion upon RASSF1C expression (Appendix Fig S1 [this file] H and I). 
Previously used RhoA and RASSF1C constructs (Appendix Fig S1 [this file] H, Fig 2 [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0002] F–H) were expressed in MDA‐MB‐231 cells and EVs were isolated as described before. 
At higher doses (40 ng/μl, Appendix Fig S2 [this file] A), EVs derived from control cells were able to promote recipient cell migration at similar rates to EVs derived from RASSF1C or RhoA. 
Strikingly, the number of invaded cells was significantly higher when cells were treated with 20 ng/μl of RASSF1C or RhoA EVs, compared to control EVs and untreated cells (Fig 3F [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0003] , Appendix Fig S2 [this file] B for a comparison of both concentrations). 
To further establish whether the small EVs population is mediating the invasive phenotype observed in the small EV fraction recovered from ultracentrifugation (Fig 3G [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0003] ), we employed a Tangential Flow Filtration/Size Exclusion Chromatography isolation protocol and incubated recipient cells with RASSF1C or control small EVs (Appendix Fig S2 [this file] C). EVs displayed protein markers already detected with the ultracentrifugation protocol (Appendix Fig S2 [this file] C, left) and NTA showed similar particle number between RASSF1C and control EVs, with this isolation method (Appendix Fig S2 [this file] C, middle). Importantly, RASSF1C small EVs still induced a significantly higher number of recipient cells to invade the Matrigel membrane, compared to control small EVs (Appendix Fig S2 [this file] C, right). 
It is important to note that, throughout our study, the treatment of recipient cells with MDA‐MB‐231 derived control EVs (expressing a control vector) already induced an increase in cell migration or invasion, compared to untreated cells (Fig 3 [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0003] E–G, Appendix Fig S2 [this file] C). 
Individual CpG site analysis allows separation of epigenetic silencing at from and therefore study of the differential contribution of the tumor suppressor RASSF1A from the oncogenic RASSF1C isoform to disease progression (Fig 6A [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0006] , Appendix Fig S3 [this file] A). 
In general, breast cancer patients that were alive at follow‐up had lower median methylation of , in agreement with the tumor suppressor role of RASSF1A, than those stages I and II patients that had died of breast cancer (Appendix Fig S3 [this file] B). In line with our data supporting a pro‐oncogenic role for RASSF1C, deceased patients had lower median methylation of , implying that expression from this promoter was active in these tumors (Appendix Fig S3 [this file] B). Intriguingly, increased methylation of (reduced RASSF1A expression) has greater significance in stage I tumors ( = 0.000001), whereas reduced methylation (increased RASSF1C expression) has more prognostic influence in late‐stage tumors ( = 7 × 10 Mann–Whitney) (Appendix Fig S3 [this file] B table). This indicates that patients with RASSF1C‐expressing tumors were at over 6‐fold higher risk of death than patients likely to express RASSF1A ( = 0.02, Appendix Fig S3 [this file] C). 
RASSF1C‐driven pathway activation leads to morphological changes in mesenchymal and epithelial cells (Fig 1 [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] A and B) that can be referred to as mesenchymal and epithelial to amoeboid transition, resulting in cytoskeleton reorganization, higher cell invasion (Fig 1 [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] C,F,G, Appendix Fig S1 [this file] F–I) and dissemination (Fig 1I [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0001] ). 
RASSF1C‐derived EVs fall in the small EVs category (Fig 3B [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0003] , Appendix Fig S2 [this file] C), and their secretion appears to be sustained by RhoA (Fig 3 [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0003] D,F,G). 
Furthermore, we highlight the relevance of the described biological mechanisms by providing a direct clinical correlation between methylation pattern and survival in breast cancer patients (Fig 6C [rid=embj2021107680-fig-0006] , Appendix Fig S3 [this file] C).",pdf,"RASSF1C oncogene elicits amoeboid invasion, cancer stemness, and extracellular vesicle release via a SRC/Rho axis",XML,,,,,,,

Two of the three iPSC lines used for the organoid cultures have previously been described by us (iPSC 1, 3) and iPSC 5 was similarly generated and characterized (Supplementary Fig. 1a–h [this file] ; Table 1 [rid=Tab1] ). The presence of neuronal architecture and of astrocytes was confirmed by using a range of markers at day 31 (Supplementary Fig. 1i–p [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , 2 [this file] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] . 
The fraction IBA-1 cells within organoids showed limited variation between batches, timepoints, and donors (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c [this file] ), and microglia quantity was positively correlated with TUJ1 expression (Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] ). Furthermore, microglia-containing organoids demonstrated proper neuronal development and cortical layer organization, based on expression of NEUN, PAX6, CTIP2, and TBR1 (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). 
At this timepoint a clear increase in expression of other classical microglia markers was observed, i.e., IBA-1 CD11b (Fig. 2a [rid=Fig2] ), , , and CD45 (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] . , Double immunostainings of IBA-1 combined with nuclear PU.1 ( ) and CD68 ( ) at day 52. 
Inter-donor variability was small (oMG = 0.91 ± 0.001) when examined with Spearman correlation coefficients (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). Unsupervised hierarchical clustering shows that oMG clustered separately from adult microglia (adult MG1) (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). When comparing the data with the original iPSC lines and fibroblasts from the same donors, unsupervised hierarchical clustering, Spearman correlation coefficients, and principal component analyses (PCA) (Fig. 3a, b [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ) showed that both at day 38 and day 52 oMG closely resemble adult MG1. 
See also Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , and Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM3] and 2 [rid=MOESM4] 
Despite this clustering, Spearman correlation coefficients showed that the transcriptomic profiles of all microglia and microglia-like cells were relatively similar ( = 0.7 ± 0.07) (Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] ). The Spearman correlation analyses of the transcriptomes of oMG day 52, adult MG1, iPSC MG and fetal MG by using microglia-specific transcription factors (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ) showed a strong correlation between iPSC MG and fetal MG ( = 0.96), whereas transcription factor profiles of oMG correlated most with those of adult MG1 ( = 0.8). The correlation between adult MG1 and fetal MG was low ( = 0.37) in this analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ). 
To further analyze differences in gene expression between oMG and adult MG, we analyzed transcriptomic differences between day oMG and adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. 4f–h [this file] ). Sample variability and size resulted in high Log2fold changes and therefore shrinkage correction was performed. 1220 genes remained that were significantly upregulated in oMG day 52 and 1271 genes in MG1 (FDR < 0.05) whereas 2400 genes were significantly upregulated in oMG at day 38 and 2070 in adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. 4i, j [this file] ). 
The transcriptomes of day 38 and day 52 oMG were most similar with 2160 differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 4k [this file] , FDR < 0.05). 
Indeed, postsynaptic responses to presynaptic release of glutamate were detected at day 52 as evidenced by spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (sEPSCs) (Supplementary Fig. 1q [this file] ). Further, voltage-dependent sodium channels were present as inward currents were registered in response to evoked increases in membrane potential (Supplementary Fig. 1r, s [this file] ). 
Organoids were differentiated using a modified version of a previously published protocol (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ) . 
Cells were sorted/gated that were alive, single, and CD11b /CD45 with the FACSAria III (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). The mean percentage of CD11b /CD45 cells of iPSC donors 1, 3, and 5 was 0.83% ± 0.3 at both timepoints for oMG (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ). 
Absolute levels of expression were determined (2 ) and normalized with the geomean of two reference genes and (see primer sequences in Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Sorting efficiency was confirmed by assessing the expression of specific microglia- and non-microglia-related genes in three batches of oMG 1 and adult MG1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). 
See Supplementary Table 4 [this file] for antibodies used in this study. 
A macro in FIJI was created with the following steps: background subtraction (rollingbal set to 10 (hoechst) or 78 (TUJ1, IBA-1) pixels; contrast was automatically enhanced; automated default threshold applied; particles were quantified with size of > 5 (hoechst) or > 10 (TUJ1, IBA-1) pixels; positive area was summarized; TUJ1 and IBA-1 was normalized by dividing the positive area by the hoechst positive nuclear area (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b, d [this file] ). 
A panel of microglia markers was selected based on literature (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Protein expression was measured in cells that were gated to be alive, single, and CD11b (Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] ). 
The voltage-dependent sodium currents were activated with depolarizing voltage steps with duration of 100 ms starting from –60 mV with increments of 10 mV to + 40 mV (Supplementary Fig. S2E [this file] ).",pdf,Microglia innately develop within cerebral organoids,XML,,,,,,,

GO-pathway analysis on all DEGs did not show any significantly enriched pathways in adult MG1 vs. oMG, whereas oMG showed enrichment for “collagen catabolic process”, “extracellular matrix organization”, “negative chemotaxis”, “positive regulation of synapse assembly”, and “endodermal cell differentiation” compared to adult MG1 (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). Myeloid function-related terms were detected by GO-pathway analysis of common genes (between adult MG1 and day 52 oMG), such as “nervous system development”, “interleukin-12-mediated signaling pathway”, and “neutrophil degranulation” (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). 
Several development-related terms were shared between day 38 and day 52 oMG, such as “nervous system development”, “neutrophil degranulation”, “cell adhesion”, and “receptor internalization” (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ).",xlsx,Microglia innately develop within cerebral organoids,XML,,,,,,,

Among the mesocarp auxin responsive genes, several encode elements regulating transport (ctg2448, ctg2449 and ctg2789 [ 25 [rid=B25] ] Additional file 1 [this file] ), indicating that auxin movement in this tissue is a relevant process, thus strengthening the hypothesis that auxin produced by the seed may behave as a signal efficiently transported to and within the mesocarp. 
The CK-mediated up-regulation of genes encoding sorbitol dehydrogenases (ctg636 and ctg1378, Additional file 1 [this file] ) appears particularly interesting, as this might increase the sink strength of the seed and attract photoassimilates to the entire fruit, which become more competitive in the partitioning process [ 33 [rid=B33] ]. 
In fact, during late seed development, ABA levels are known to increase and GA-related genes such as ctg3430, encoding a LTP-like, are down-regulated (Figure 3 [rid=F3] and Additional file 1 [this file] ).

( ) I34 in Bacteria is catalysed by the homodimeric TadA enzyme, from which the eukaryotic ADAT2/ADAT3 heterodimeric enzyme evolved. 
Guide strands were designed using public resources ( http://crispr.mit.edu (http://crispr.mit.edu) ) (see Supplementary Table S1 [this file] for detailed oligonucleotide sequences), and were cloned into px330 SV40-GFP vector (gift from Dr Eduard Batlle, IRB Barcelona) ( 43 [rid=B43] ) as described in ( 44 [rid=B44] ). 
Plasmid for hADAT2 over expression was generated by Gateway cloning system following the manufacturer's protocol (hADAT2-pDONR221) using specific oligonucleotides ( Supplementary Table S1 [this file] ; and see Supplementary methods). hADAT2 gene was amplified from HEK293T cDNA. hADAT2-pLenti construct was generated by performing an LR reaction using hADAT2-pDONR221 and pLenti vector (Adgene plasmid 19068: pLenti PGK Puro DEST W529-2) following the manufacturer's protocol. 
See Supplementary methods [this file] for details on antibodies used in this study. 
Details on primers used are shown in Supplementary Table S1 [this file] ( 17 [rid=B17] , 47–49 [rid=B47] ). 
For control experiments depicted in Supplementary Figure S3E [this file] , cells were harvested with Trypsin instead of PBS/2 mM EDTA. 
Each dish contained 1 × 10 cells (for experiments carried out 24 h after plating; Figure 6A [rid=F6] ) or 1 × 10 cells (for experiments carried out 72 h after plating; Supplementary Figure S4A [this file] ). 
Statistical significance of the enrichment of transcripts encoding low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins among those down-regulated in the interaction analysis was assessed via Fisher Exact Test. ( Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
Oligonucleotides used are depicted in Supplementary Table S1 [this file] (see Supplementary methods [this file] for further details). 
See Supplementary methods [this file] for further details. 
Representative plots showing the gating strategy are shown in Supplementary Figure S6D and E [this file] . 
For correlation tests reported in Figure 10C [rid=F10] , seven species with an unusual number of A34-tRNA genes (>400 genes) were excluded from the analyses and are reported in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . For results depicted in Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] , 1324 species from Bacteria and 114 species from Archaea were analysed ( Supplementary Table S6 [this file] ). 
Thus, as expected, we were unable to obtain full ADAT2 or ADAT3 knockout clones (see Materials and methods), but we did obtain heterozygous clones carrying wild type (WT) and edited alleles (‘HEK293T ADAT2 KD’ or ‘HEK293T ADAT3 KD’) ( Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] ). Editing of the ADAT2 allele resulted in the generation of a premature stop codon eight amino acids downstream of the edited site ( Supplementary Figure S1A [this file] ); while editing of the ADAT3 allele resulted in the elimination of seven residues mapping to the deaminase domain of the protein without changes in the translation reading frame ( Supplementary Figure S1B [this file] ). 
ADAT2 KD did not affect the levels of ADAT3, but we observed a mild decrease in ADAT2 protein abundance upon ADAT3 KD ( Supplementary Figure S2A [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Figure S2A [this file] . ( ) I34 levels in HEK293T CTRL (blue) and ADAT2 KD (red) cells as evaluated by tRNA-Seq. See also Supplementary Figure S2B [this file] . ( ) Heatmap visualization of tRNA gene expression at isodecoder level (tRNAs with the same anticodon) in HEK293T CTRL and ADAT2 KD cells as evaluated by tRNA-Seq. See also Supplementary Figure S2C [this file] and Supplementary Table S2 [this file] . 
Upon ADAT2 KD, we detected reduced levels of I34 on all its tRNA substrates, as seen by next generation sequencing of tRNAs (Figure 2B [rid=F2] ), without significant variations in tRNA transcript abundance (Figure 2C [rid=F2] and Supplementary Table S2 [this file] ). As a control, we verified that the amount of the unrelated tRNA modification 1-methylinosine (m I) present at position 37 of tRNA , and catalysed by ADAT1 ( 67 [rid=B67] ), was not affected ( Supplementary Figure S2B [this file] ). Similar results were observed upon shRNA-mediated KD of ADAT2 ( 17 [rid=B17] ) ( Supplementary Figure S2B-C [this file] ). 
However, pulse-chase analyses of general protein synthesis did not reveal defects in overall translation efficiency in ADAT2 KD and shADAT2 cells (Figure 3A [rid=F3] and Supplementary Figure S2D [this file] ). As a control, cycloheximide (CHX) treatment abolished the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acid into proteins in both cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S2E [this file] ).

( ) Kinetics of protein synthesis in HEK293T CTRL (blue) and ADAT2 KD (red) cells upon monitoring the amount of TCA-precipitable label ( S-Met/Cys) from each cell lysate at the indicated time-points. See also Supplementary Figure S2E [this file] . ( ) Analyses of UPR markers on the indicated cell lines in the presence (+) or absence (−) of thapsigargin (Tg), that induces UPR. See also Supplementary Table S3 [this file] . 
We also performed mass spectrometry-based whole proteomics analyses (iTRAQ) and found only 7 differentially expressed proteins (|FC| > 1.5; adj. -value < 0.1) among 2280 detected proteins (Figure 3G [rid=F3] and Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ), indicating that 99.7% of detected proteins present unaltered levels under these conditions. 
We measured cell growth to assess the general physiological state of the cell after silencing ADAT2 or ADAT3, and found a reduced growth rate caused by a general deceleration of the cell cycle (Figure 4A [rid=F4] , B and Supplementary Figure S3A [this file] ). We observed similar phenotypes in different shADAT2 human cell lines ( Supplementary Figure S3B and C [this file] ), and we were able to fully recover growth rates in ADAT2 KD cells by introduction of a lentiviral ADAT2 expression system (‘HEK293T ADAT2 KD pLenti-hADAT2′) (Figure 4C [rid=F4] ). This phenotype was transient (Figure 4D [rid=F4] ), and absent in cells detached using PBS-EDTA ( Supplementary Figure S3D [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Figure S3A–C [this file] . ( ) Cell cycle analysis of HEK293T CTRL (blue-bordered bars) and ADAT2 KD (red-bordered bars) cells as evaluated by FACS over a 12-h period. See also Supplementary Figure S3D [this file] . 
See also Supplementary Figure S3E [this file] . 
We found that ADAT2 KD cells display impaired adhesion to collagens (Col II, Col IV) and vitronectin (VN), but not to fibronectin (FN), laminin (LN) or tenascin (TN) (Figure 5C [rid=F5] and Supplementary Figure S3E [this file] ). 
At 72 h after trypsin treatment and plating, we observed these differences substantially reduced, consistent with proteome normalization after protease treatment ( Supplementary Figure S4A [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Figure S4A [this file] . ( ) Polysome to Monosome ratio (P/M) obtained from experiments as in (A). See also Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . 
We found that ADAT2 KD cells presented a significant depletion in the P/M ratio at 24 h after trypsin treatment (Figure 6B [rid=F6] ), a difference that disappeared at 72 h after treatment ( Supplementary Figure S4B [this file] ). 
We detected a significant depletion of ADAT2 transcripts (FC < 1.5; adj. -value < 0.1) in the HP fraction of the ADAT2 KD cell line without significant changes in total RNA ( Supplementary Figure S4C [this file] ), indicating translational impairment. This is consistent with ribosomal drop-off caused by the premature stop codon introduced in this gene by CRISPR/Cas9 editing ( Supplementary Figure S1A [this file] , see also Figure 2A [rid=F2] ). In agreement with previous observations, we did not observe alterations of ADAT3 transcript levels in total RNA or HP fractions in this cell line ( Supplementary Figure S4C [this file] , see also Figure 2A [rid=F2] and Supplementary Figure S2A [this file] ). 
Although we found 726 differentially enriched or depleted (|FC| > 1.5; adj. -value < 0.1) protein-coding genes in the HP fractions of ADAT2 KD cells ( Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ), a global analysis of translation efficiency (TE) (cumulative log FC HP versus total) found no major differences in ADAT2 KD cells compared to CTRL cells ( -value = 0.49; Figure 6C [rid=F6] ). 
On the other hand, HP fractions after ADAT2 KD are significantly enriched in transcripts linked to cellular differentiation, calcium signalling, protein and mRNA stabilization, telomere maintenance, and protein ubiquitination (Figure 6D [rid=F6] , E and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Figure S5A–C [this file] . ( ) Evaluation of eGFP fluorescence by FACS in the indicated cell lines when transfected with eGFP constructs depicted in (A). See also Supplementary Figure S5D [this file] . 
Likewise, we detected equivalent eGFP production in HEK293T shCV and shADAT2 cells, and for both expression constructs ( Supplementary Figure S5A and B [this file] ). In addition, we did not find signs of mistranslation based on peptide analysis by mass spectrometry ( Supplementary Figure S5C [this file] ). 
First, we identified human transcripts encoding proteins with low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich regions, and ranked them according to the size of these regions, and their relative enrichment in TAPSLIVR codons cognate for I34-tRNAs ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). We found that this subset of the human proteome is associated to cellular structure, morphology, adhesion, cell signalling, and interaction with the extracellular space ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). We further found that these low-complexity regions are characteristic of mucin-like domains (MLDs) ( 75 [rid=B75] ), and are abundant in Mucins (MUC) and other proteins involved in ECM regulation and adhesion ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). 
We purified SDC3-RLuc and SDC3(G-end)-RLuc from all cell lines and found their protein sequences to be identical by mass spectrometry ( Supplementary Figure S5D [this file] ). 
Using an interaction analysis (see Materials and methods) we found that 7 out of the 36 genes with impaired TE in ADAT2 KD cells (FC HP versus total < 1.5; -value < 0.05) encoded proteins with TAPSLIVR-rich low-complexity regions (Figure 8A [rid=F8] and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . ( ) Histogram of a permutation test using 10 000 sets of 31 random transcripts detected in experiments shown in (A). 
This significance is increased when the analysis is restricted to highly translated transcripts in CTRL cells (i.e. FC HP CTRL versus Total CTRL > 0) (550 transcripts encoding low-complexity TAPSLIVR regions; -value = 4.985e–14; Fisher exact test) ( Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
First, we examined the expression of Dystroglycan 1 (coded by the gene ) (Figure 9A [rid=F9] ) in HT29-M6 shCV and shADAT2 cells ( Supplementary Figure S3B, C [this file] and Supplementary Figure S6A [this file] ).

See also Supplementary Figure S6B-C [this file] . ( ) Distribution of TAPSLIVR (ADAT amino acids; green curve) and of codons decoded by I34-tRNAs (ADAT codons; orange curve) along the coding sequence of MUC5AC. See also Supplementary Figure S6D and E [this file] . ( ) MUC5AC expression in NCI-H292 shCV and shADAT2 cells treated (+) or not (−) with AREG, quantified by confocal microscopy. 
We evaluated a number of molecular markers of AREG-induced signalling and found that ADAT2 depletion did not generally affect the cellular response to AREG treatment ( Supplementary Figure S6B-C [this file] ). 
However, we detected a strong reduction in MUC5AC protein levels in shADAT2 cells, both by FACS analyses (∼ 30% reduction, Figure 9G [rid=F9] and Supplementary Figure S6D-E [this file] ) and immunohistochemistry (∼70% reduction, Figure 9H [rid=F9] ), consistent with a severe translational defect. 
See also Supplementary Table S6 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] . ( ) Histogram of permutation tests using 5000 sets of random human proteins, showing the distribution of homologs in unicellular eukaryotes relative to multicellular in eukaryotes (average ratio) for each random set analysed (subsamplings). See also Supplementary Table S7 [this file] . ( ) Boxplot representation of the abundance of homologs to low-complexity TASPLIVR-rich human proteins, and that contain low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich regions, in unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. 
We found a positive trend ( = 0.53, -value = 3.7e–13, Spearman) between the abundance of low-complexity TASPLIVR-rich proteins and A34-tRNA gene content (Figure 10C [rid=F10] and Supplementary Table S6 [this file] ). Of note and as expected, proteins with low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich regions are rare in bacterial and archaeal genomes (Figure 10B [rid=F10] ), which are depleted of I34-tRNAs ( Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] ). 
The capacity to synthesize cell adhesion molecules was instrumental for the origin of multicellularity ( 81–84 [rid=B81] ), and low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins are involved in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix interactions ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). We further evaluated the presence of low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich regions within these proteins and detected a 7.3-fold enrichment in multicellular species (Figure 10E [rid=F10] and Supplementary Table S7 [this file] ). 
This depletion is achieved without causing additional alterations to the tRNA pool, and the resulting cells are still viable (Figures 2 [rid=F2] and 4 [rid=F4] , Supplementary Figure S2B-C [this file] and Supplementary Table S2 [this file] ). Moreover, we observe that reduced I34 levels cause an abnormal cellular morphology upon trypsin treatments (Figure 4D [rid=F4] and Supplementary Figure S3D [this file] ), indicating that I34-tRNAs are required for the synthesis of membrane proteins involved in interactions with the extracellular environment. Silencing of ADAT2 also causes a notable decrease in transcripts with high ribosomal occupancy after trypsin treatment (Figure 6A [rid=F6] ), and within this group, we find an overrepresentation of genes linked to cell adhesion, response to extracellular stimuli and cell-cell signalling (Figure 6D [rid=F6] and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ), indicating that extracellular polypeptides predominate among those affected by a partial depletion of I34-tRNAs. 
Indeed, we do not find translation to be generally compromised when I34-tRNA levels are reduced, as shown by monitoring protein synthesis rates through metabolic labelling, analysing soluble and insoluble protein fractions, and evaluating UPR markers and levels of protein ubiquitination (Figure 3A [rid=F3] – F [rid=F3] and Supplementary Figure S2D [this file] ). Furthermore, whole proteome mass spectrometry analyses revealed only 7 proteins out of 2280 to be differentially expressed (2 proteins upregulated and 5 downregulated) (Figure 3G [rid=F3] and Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ). This indicates that the majority of the differential abundance of transcripts associated to ribosomes found in ADAT2 KD cells could be explained by changes in transcriptional rates (Figure 6 [rid=F6] and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
An analysis of low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins functionally links this subset of the human proteome to cellular integrity, adhesion, and generation of, and interaction with the ECM, among others ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). We detected translational defects in membrane-associated proteins such as LIPE, SPNS2, ORAI3, PIANP and SEMA6C (Figure 8A [rid=F8] and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ) ( 90 [rid=B90] ), and in proteins containing MLDs ( 75–77 [rid=B75] ) such as SDC3, Dystroglycan and MUC5AC (Figures 7D [rid=F7] – F [rid=F7] and Figure 9 [rid=F9] ). Notably, not all low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins are transmembrane or secretory proteins ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ), thus I34-tRNA depletion may affect translation of proteins both in the cytosol and the endoplasmic reticulum ( 91 [rid=B91] ). The most striking translational phenotype caused by ADAT2 silencing was the reduction in the synthesis of MUC5AC protein in NCI-H292 cells stimulated with AREG, despite a ∼1000-fold transcriptional activation of the gene (Figure 9D [rid=F9] – H [rid=F9] and Supplementary Figure S6B–E [this file] ). 
Our polysome profiling data detects translational impairment on transcripts encoding low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins that are highly translated in CTRL cells (Figure 8 [rid=F8] and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
We determined that depletion of I34-tRNAs primarily affects translational efficiency, but not accuracy, of low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins, as seen by the time-dependent recovery of phenotypes (Figures 4D [rid=F4] and 6A [rid=F6] - B [rid=F6] and Supplementary Figure S4A-B [this file] ), time-course analysis of translation (Figure 7I [rid=F7] ), and mass spectrometry analyses ( Supplementary Figure S5D [this file] ). 
We characterized the phylogenetic distribution of homologs to human proteins with low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich regions that depend on I34-tRNAs for their synthesis, and found that they are almost limited to eukaryotic species that abundantly utilize I34-tRNAs (Figure 10A [rid=F10] , B and Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] ). Here we show that, although I34-tRNAs exist in deeply-rooted eukaryotic groups ( 10 [rid=B10] , 24 [rid=B24] , 25 [rid=B25] ), their abundance correlates with that of proteins with low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich regions (Figure 10C [rid=F10] , Supplementary Table S6 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] ). Strikingly, we find such proteins to be scarce in unicellular eukaryotes, with the sole exception of holozoan protists (the closest known relatives of metazoans ( 25 [rid=B25] )), where the abundance of low-complexity TAPSLIVR-rich proteins is comparable to that of multicellular species (Figure 10D [rid=F10] - E [rid=F10] and Supplementary Table S7 [this file] )",zip,Human tRNAs with inosine 34 are essential to efficiently translate eukarya-specific low-complexity proteins,XML,,,,,,,

Therefore, to reveal how the three types of H3/H4-containing particles are distributed along sperm DNA, we performed paired-end sequencing of DNA fragments generated by MNase digestion of sperm chromatin (~7 × genome coverage, Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
We used internal standard calibrated chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ICeChIP-seq ) to estimate the percentage of histone H3 methylation at a given locus in a sperm population (apparent histone methylation density, HMD) (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] and ‘Methods’). 
To test this hypothesis, we first incubated permeabilised sperm in egg extract to mimic the chromatin assembly and replication steps associated with the first embryonic cycle (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). However, the context within which high histone H3 methylation occurs (with or without enrichment for a given H3 particle) is not generally predictive of the fate of the methylated histone post replication (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). Finally, sperm incubation with extracts containing the DNA replication inhibitor geminin suggests that most histone methylation peak loss following treatment is associated with chromatin assembly on sperm DNA rather than with DNA replication (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
In addition, a significant proportion of genes sensitive to both demethylation of H3K27 and depletion for the maternally provided factor Ascl1 harbour homogeneously methylated H3K27 and the binding motif for this transcription factor (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
To that end human sperm from a fertile individual were treated with an MNase concentration that yields nucleosome-sized fragments as well as smaller fragments (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). Interestingly, in human, H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 ChIP recovers only nucleosome-sized fragment (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
Overall, the peaks identified are well conserved between our study and previous work indicating that peak calling is consistent across a range of MNase treatments (Supplementary Data 7 [this file0] ). Nonetheless, some human sperm genes have peaks of high density of histone H3K4me3 (130 genes) or H3K27me3 (320 genes) around their TSSs (i.e., BMI1, TBX3, Fig. 7c [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Data 8 [this file1] ). However, in both species the set of genes with high H3K27me3 HMD is related to developmental functions (Supplementary Tables 3 [this file] and 7 [this file] ).

Moreover, similar to hepatocytes isolated form ; mice, those from untreated wild-type mice were also capable of propagating in culture (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). 
The changes in gene expression were promptly induced starting from 1 day of 3D culture (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). The hepatic maturation of dediHep aggregates could also be induced from dediHeps propagated in long-term monolayer culture (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). 
These dediHep-derived hepatocytes did not express the mesenchymal cell markers Vim and α-smooth muscle actin (αSMA) (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
Cdx2 was co-expressed with Alb in dediHeps (Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] ) and gradually disappeared from dediHeps during re-differentiation into hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
These SOs were composed of actively proliferating, polarized intestinal epithelial cells that express E-cad basolaterally, Villin (also known as Vil1) apically, and nuclear Cdx2 and Sox9 (Fig. 5c [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ), similar to FIPC-derived SOs . Also, dediHep-derived SOs were formed by cells expressing CK19 and Hnf4α but not Alb, indicating that these SOs were not biliary organoids that express CK19 but not Hnf4α and Alb (Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). Moreover, addition of forskolin (FSK) with or without the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) inhibitor CFTRinh-172 to the culture media blocked or induced the swelling of dediHep-derived SOs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
Forced expression of promotes the generation of SOs from dediHeps (Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). Changing the additives in the medium from WCENR to ENR is necessary for the efficient formation of BOs even from dediHeps overexpressing (Supplementary Fig. 8b, c [this file] ). dediHep-derived BOs could be maintained by repeated passaging in long-term 3D culture (Supplementary Fig. 8d [this file] ). 
Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analyses also revealed that the expression levels of differentiated intestinal epithelial cell markers, such as , , and , and those of dediHep markers, such as and , significantly increased and decreased, respectively, in BOs derived from exogenous -expressing dediHeps (Fig. 6g [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
In fact, the proliferative capacity of CLiPs was significantly lower than that of dediHeps (Supplementary Fig. 10a [this file] ). Dedifferentiation of human hepatocytes into CLiPs also activates the expression of the mesenchymal cell markers and , in addition to , , and (Supplementary Fig. 10b [this file] ). 
Meanwhile, Yap immediately disappeared from the nucleus of dediHeps as a result of cell-aggregate formation that induced re-differentiation of dediHeps into growth-arrested functional hepatocytes under 3D culture conditions (Fig. 8e [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
This inactivation blocked the conversion of hepatocytes to dediHeps in a concentration-dependent manner in verteporfin (Fig. 8g, h [rid=Fig8] ) and led to higher expression of several genes encoding liver enzymes and lower expression of and than hepatocytes cultured without verteporfin (Fig. 8i [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 12 [this file] ). Our data demonstrated that dediHep-derived SOs were composed of cells marked with nuclear Yap, and their formation was nearly completely blocked in culture with verteporfin (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] ). 
The primary and secondary antibodies used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] . 
To examine the expression of additional genes, qPCR was performed using the THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. qPCR primers for , , , , , , , , and are listed in Supplementary Table 2 [this file] .",pdf,Hepatocytes differentiate into intestinal epithelial cells through a hybrid epithelial/mesenchymal cell state in culture,XML,,,,,,,

Figures S1–S5,local-data,mmc1,No description,Document  S1.  Figures  S1–S5,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"To investigate Orb6 function at native expression levels, we introduced the same mutation (M170A) at the endogenous locus; throughout this work, we refer to our new allele as We inhibited Orb6-as2 using the nucleotide competitive analog 3-BrB-PP1, although other analogs were equally effective ( Figures S1 [this file] A and S1B). Consistent with previous work ( Das et al., 2009 [rid=bib17] , Nuñez et al., 2016 [rid=bib56] ), Orb6 inhibition led to an increase in cell width, partial ectopic localization of Cdc42-GTP (imaged with CRIB-3mCitrine) ( Mutavchiev et al., 2016 [rid=bib54] ) and the actin cytoskeleton away from cell tips (i.e., on cell sides), and cell-separation defects during septation ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] A, 1C, S1 [this file] C, and S1D; Video S1 [rid=mmc5] ). These phenotypes were specific to cells treated with 3-BrB-PP1 ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] C and S1 [this file] B; Videos S2 [rid=mmc6] and S3 [rid=mmc7] ). Also consistent with previous work, ectopic localization of Cdc42-GTP and actin in Orb6-inhibited cells was suppressed by ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] A, S1 [this file] C, and S1D; Video S1 [rid=mmc5] ) ( Das et al., 2009 [rid=bib17] ). 
See also Figure S1 [this file] and Videos S2 [rid=mmc6] and S3 [rid=mmc7] . 
The width increase of cells at 37°C (restrictive temperature) was greater than that of Orb6-inhibited cells at 25°C, with many cells becoming round ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] B, 1C, and S1 [this file] B) ( Verde et al., 1998 [rid=bib76] ). 
This was surprising, because Cdc42-GTP enrichment on the plasma membrane is normally closely correlated with active cell growth ( Figure S1 [this file] E) ( Tatebe et al., 2008 [rid=bib73] ). 
To further characterize cessation of elongation and decreased cell-volume expansion in Orb6-inhibited cells, we imaged mCherry-tagged beta-glucan synthase subunit Bgs4, a multipass transmembrane protein required for cell wall synthesis at sites of active growth (i.e., cell tips during interphase and the cell midzone during cytokinesis) ( Figure S1 [this file] E) ( Cortés et al., 2005 [rid=bib13] , Cortés et al., 2015 [rid=bib14] ). Control wild-type ( ) cells treated with 3-BrB-PP1 showed no change in mCherry-Bgs4 localization and continued to elongate ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] A and S1 [this file] F). 
See also Figure S1 [this file] . 
In mass spectrometry experiments associated with phosphoproteomics analysis after Orb6 inhibition (described later), we found that 3-BrB-PP1 treatment leads to increased intracellular levels of the major acid phosphatase Pho1 ( Figure S2 [this file] B). Increased Pho1 levels likely account for the increased ACP secretion seen in 3-BrB-PP1-treated wild-type cells as a result of mass action. 3-BrB-PP1 treatment also led to increased intracellular Pho1 levels in cells ( Figure S2 [this file] B), even though these cells showed decreased ACP secretion. 
To identify Orb6 substrates, we combined stable isotope labeling with amino acids in culture (SILAC) ( Bicho et al., 2010 [rid=bib6] , Macek et al., 2017 [rid=bib44] , Ong and Mann, 2006 [rid=bib58] ) with global phosphoproteomics analysis ( Figure S2 [this file] A). 
See also Figures S2 [this file] and S3 [this file] . 
Among the 55 phosphosites with significantly decreased phosphorylation in all three experiments, 36 (65%) contained a basic amino acid (histidine, arginine, or lysine) at the −3 position relative to the phosphorylated residue ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] B, S2 [this file] C, and S2D; Table S2 [rid=mmc3] ). 
In Sec5-mCherry immunoprecipitates, levels of all other exocyst proteins (Sec3, Sec6, Sec8, Sec10, Sec15, Exo70, and Exo84) were similar between control and Orb6-inhibited cells, suggesting that exocyst assembly is not grossly affected by Orb6 inhibition ( Figures S3 [this file] A and S3B). Consistent with global phosphoproteomics data, immunoprecipitates from Orb6-inhibited cells showed decreased phosphorylation of Sec3 serine-201 and Sec5 serine-50, as well as decreased phosphorylation of a novel site, Sec8 serine-440 ( Figures S3 [this file] C and S3D; the Sec8 site does not correspond to the NDR/LATS consensus). We also found that unlike Sec5 and Sec8, Sec3 contains numerous additional phosphosites with modestly increased or decreased phosphorylation after Orb6 inhibition ( Figures S3 [this file] C and S3D). 
In untreated cells, fluorescent-tagged exocyst proteins Sec3, Sec5, Sec8, and Exo70 localized to cell tips in interphase and the septation zone during division, while after Orb6 inhibition, these proteins showed decreased localization at cell tips and ectopic puncta on the peripheral cortex ( Figure 6 [rid=fig6] ; Video S7 [this file1] ). By contrast, 3-BrB-PP1-treated wild-type ( ) cells displayed normal exocyst localization ( Figure S4 [this file] ). 
Video S7 [this file1] shows changes in Sec3-3mCherry and Sec5-3mCherry localization at a higher time resolution. See also Figure S4 [this file] . 
To test the role of Sec3 serine-201 and Sec5 serine-50 phosphorylation in exocytosis, we mutated these residues to non-phosphorylatable alanine at their endogenous loci to make the mutants and Both single mutants, as well as a double mutant, were viable under normal growth conditions at 25°C and 36°C ( Figures 7 [rid=fig7] and S5 [this file] A). 
See also Figure S5 [this file] and Video S8 [this file2] . 
Neither and single mutants nor the double mutant showed an increased septation index relative to wild-type cells ( Figures 7 [rid=fig7] C, 7D, and S5 [this file] A). 
All mutant combinations were viable at 25°C and 36°C ( Figures 7 [rid=fig7] and S5 [this file] A). However, the septation index was significantly increased in double mutants compared to either single mutant at both 25°C and 36°C; more than 75% of cells contained at least one septum, and 25% of cells contained multiple septa ( Figures 7 [rid=fig7] C, 7D, and S5 [this file] A). This was not altered by further deletion of ( Figures S5 [this file] B and S5C). The septation index in and mutants was not greatly altered by the mutation, although there were somewhat fewer multi-septate cells at 25°C compared to 36°C ( Figures 7 [rid=fig7] C, 7D, and S5 [this file] A); the reasons for this are not yet clear. 
However, because spores of the double-mutant failed to germinate ( Figure S5 [this file] D), we were unable to test this directly. Both proteins localized normally to cell tips and the septation zone, indicating that exocyst localization per se was not adversely affected ( Figures S5 [this file] E and S5F). 
Orb6 inhibition leads to cessation of cell elongation and decreased exocyst at cell tips, whereas cells, despite impaired ACP secretion and cell-separation defects, can grow in a polarized fashion and maintain exocyst at cell tips ( Figures 7 [rid=fig7] and S5 [this file] ). Nearly all of the highest-ranking phosphosites (i.e., those with highest reproducibility and greatest fold decrease after Orb6 inhibition) match the NDR/LATS consensus ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] and S2 [this file] ; Table S2 [rid=mmc3] ), suggesting that they are direct substrates of Orb6.",pdf,Fission Yeast NDR/LATS Kinase Orb6 Regulates Exocytosis via Phosphorylation of the Exocyst Complex,XML,,,,,,,

Among the 15 phosphosites with 4-fold or greater decreased phosphorylation in all three experiments, 12 showed a perfect match to the NDR/LATS consensus, including histidine at the −5 position, suggesting that they are direct Orb6 targets ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] B; Table S2 [this file] ).

The results in Fig. 1f [rid=Fig1] showed that, in contrast to the adjacent tumor tissues, ITGBL1 was overexpressed in CRC tumor tissues, and its expression levels were reversely correlated with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) of CRC patients (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b [this file] ). 
Again, significantly higher protein levels of ITGBL1 were found in primary CRC tumors, and matched lung and liver metastasis (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] , Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). The mRNA expression was inversely correlated with OS (Supplementary Fig. 2a–c [this file] ). A wide range of protein expression levels of ITGBL1 was also detected in 90 CRC tissues (only five cases overlapping with above 467 CRC cases), and the protein expressions of ITGBL1 were inversely correlated with lymphovascular invasion (Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] ). 
Moreover, the mRNA expression of ITGBL1 in human CRC tumor samples had strong correlation with the ITGBL1 levels in corresponding plasma EVs of CRC patients (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Multivariate Cox regression analysis further revealed that both ITGBL1 levels in EVs and distant metastasis served as independent predictors of poor prognosis in CRC patients (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). In addition to ITGBL1, several other integrins, including ITGα6, ITGβ4, and ITGβ1 were also packed in the plasma EVs of CRC patients with lung metastases, whereas ITGα5 and ITGβ5 were found in liver metastases (Supplementary Fig. 3b–f [this file] ). 
Genetic gain- and loss-of-function experiments further supported the finding that RUNX2 may regulate mRNA and protein expression (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] , Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] ). 
The total numbers of EVs from an equal number of cells were also upregulated by overexpressing RUNX2, whereas KD of RUNX2 produced the opposite effect (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] , Fig. 2k [rid=Fig2] ). ITGBL1 levels in EVs from an equal number of cells were upregulated in nSMase2-overexpressing cells, but downregulated in nSMase2 KD cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] , Fig. 2p [rid=Fig2] ). 
In vivo tracing of the injected EVs showed that CRC-derived EVs were accumulated in lung or liver, and very weak signals in the brain and bone marrow (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). Notably, CRC-ITGBL1-enriched EVs increased the frequency of α-SMA + hStCs, myofibroblasts, FN deposition, and recruitments of F4/80 macrophage, and Ly6G myeloid cells to the liver (Fig. 3e [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 5b–e [this file] ) or lung (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 5f–i [this file] ). 
In contrast to liver and lung, the brain and bone tissues lacked detectable metastases (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ). Immunofluenrescence assay of α-SMA, a known myofibroblastic marker, demonstrated that treatment with ITGBL1-enriched EVs increased the α-SMA + CAFs in metastatic lesions (Fig. 4g [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 6c–e [this file] ). 
Among various CRC cell lines, ITGBL1 was more highly expressed in the EVs of SW620 and LoVo, relative to others (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). The structure, size, and numbers of the isolated EVs were identified by electron microscopy and Nanosight particle tracking analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c [this file] ). Especially, abundant EVs were secreted from high-metastatic cancer cells than low-metastatic ones through a quantitative analysis of EVs isolated from an equal number of cells (Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] ). HSP70, CD63, and CD9, characteristic proteins for EVs further validated the isolated EVs (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e [this file] ). EVs isolated from normal colonic epithelial cells NCM-460 were chosen as the control EVs and their structures, sizes, numbers, and characteristics were shown in Supplementary Fig. 7f–h [this file] . 
After incubation, confocal imaging showed the presence of PKH67 spots in recipient fibroblasts and stellate cells, suggesting that EVs released by different tumor cells could be successfully delivered to fibroblasts and stellate cells in vitro (Fig. 5a, b [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 8a, b [this file] ). Consistent with in vivo data (Fig. 4h–j [rid=Fig4] ), the highly metastatic CRC cell-EVs-educated fibroblasts and stellate cells upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, myofibroblastic markers, and chemokines, including , , , , , and (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d [this file] ). More important, elevated mRNA levels of , , , , , and were detected in SW480- or SW620-derived high ITGBL1-EVs-treated fibroblasts and stellate cells, but ITGBL1-silencing ablated these effects (Supplementary Fig. 10a–d [this file] ). 
As shown in the Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] , highly metastatic CRC-derived EVs increased the expression of phosphorylated NF-κB, decreased IkappaBalpha (IκBα), and activated NF-κB signaling in WI-38 and LX-2. Detection of the relative luciferase activity of NF-κB in WI-38 and LX-2 further validated these findings (Supplementary Fig. 11c, d [this file] ). 
Treatment of fibroblasts or stellate cells with ITGBL1-enriched EVs from CRC cells showed co-location of ITGBL1 with TNFAIP3 by Co-IP and immunofluorescence detection (Supplementary Fig. 12a–d [this file] ). The subsequent Co-IP in combination with western blot experiments further validated no direct binding between ITGBL1 and other integrins (Supplementary Fig. 13a, b [this file] ). Moreover, KD of integrin β1 barely affected the regulatory effect of ITGBL1 on the NF-κB signaling pathway (Supplementary Fig. 13c, d [this file] ). 
In the subcutaneous transplantation tumors, we further confirmed the enhancement of stemness genes expression in tumors treated with conditioned medium from ITGBL1-overexpressing WI-38 or LX-2 (Supplementary Fig. 14a [this file] ). 
As shown in Fig. 8c, d [rid=Fig8] , the conditioned medium-treated HCT116 cells showed increased motility, but blocking IL-6 or IL-8 with their respective neutralizing antibodies partially reversed this increased motility (Supplementary Fig. 15a, b [this file] ). In the lung and liver metastatic tumors from Fig. 8e, f [rid=Fig8] , we further confirmed the positive adjustment of EMT-associated genes expression in metastatic tumors pretreated with conditioned medium from ITGBL1-overexpressing WI-38 or LX-2 (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c [this file] ). 
Using above lung and liver metastatic tissues from CRC patients, we detected the α-SMA (characteric marker for myofibroblastic CAFs) expression by IHC staining analysis, and the results showed high density of α-SMA + myofibroblasts around the metastatic tumors (Supplementary Fig. 16 [this file] ), implying the important function of α-SMA + myofibroblasts on metastatic CRC development. CAFs with low ITGBL1 and high ITGBL1 expression were applied for further experimentation (Supplementary Fig. 17a, b [this file] ). Expectedly, primary CAFs with high ITGBL1 expression secreted higher levels of IL-6 and IL-8 relative to low ITGBL1-expressing CAFs and NFs (Supplementary Fig. 17c, d [this file] ). Similar to fibroblasts educated by ITGBL1-enriched EVs, primary CAFs with high ITGBL1 expression promoted tumorigenicity (Supplementary Fig. 17e, f [this file] ), tumor stemness (Supplementary Fig. 17g [this file] ), metastatic growth (Supplementary Fig. 17h, i [this file] ), and EMT (Supplementary Fig. 17j [this file] ). In vitro experiments validated the fact that primary CAFs with high ITGBL1 increased expression levels of stemness-related genes and the spheroid formation (Supplementary Fig. 18a, b [this file] ). Additionally, ITGBL1 increased the expression levels of EMT-associated genes and tumor cells migration (Supplementary Fig. 18c, d [this file] ). 
Additionally, RUNX2 promotes the CRC EMT through activation of fibroblasts, i.e., the transition into myofibroblasts, which are known to facilitate tumor growth and invasiveness (Supplementary Fig. 19 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, our preliminary study also showed that TGF-β in the EVs was not alerted in ITGBL1 overexpressing or silencing CRC cells (Supplementary Fig. 20a [this file] ), and their effect on TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway was little in the targeted HCT116 cells and CAFs from liver metastatic tumors (Supplementary Fig. 20b, c [this file] ). Nevertheless, we observed the increased secretion of cytokines TGF-β in the activated hepatic stellate cells LX-2 upon indicated EVs treatment (Supplementary Fig. 20d [this file] ), companying with positive effect on TGF-β/Smads signaling pathway in HCT116 cells (Supplementary Fig. 20e, f [this file] ). 
Consistent with the results in immunedeficient nude mice, education of CRC-ITGBL1-enriched EVs increased recruitment of α-SMA + hStCs, myofibroblasts, FN deposition, F4/80 macrophage, and Ly6G myeloid cells migration to the liver and lung of C57Bl/6 mice (Supplementary Fig. 21a, b [this file] ), supporting the concept of a pre-metastatic niche formation. Importantly, the experimental lung and liver metastasis model, and the cecum orthotopic tumor metastasis model validate ITGBL1-enriched EVs accelerated metastatic growth (Supplementary Fig. 22a–c [this file] ). Expression levels of , , , , , and are increased in ITGBL1-enriched EVs-treated CAFs (Supplementary Fig. 22d–f [this file] ).

Transparent  Methods,  Figures  S1–S8,  and  Tables  S1–S3",supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"In the screen, we found nearly 4,000 imidazopyridine derivatives with significantly differential luciferase activities in the HEK-OCT4 reporter cell line ( Figure S1 [this file] A). 
Red, upregulated genes; blue, downregulated genes. p values represent values after multitest adjustment (see details in Transparent Methods [this file] ). 
We found nearly 10-fold inductions of both OCT4 and NANOG by compound 1 at low nanomolar doses when compared with untreated cells ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] B, 1C, and S1 [this file] B). We found the induction of T and GATA4 in human PSCs (hPSCs) treated with 10 μM O4I3 ( Figure S1 [this file] C), suggesting that O4I3 might transiently hyperactivate OCT4 at high concentrations, which led to the differentiation and reduction of OCT4 activity ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] B). We also tested the activity of zolpidem (containing the imidazopyridine backbone) in both reporter cell lines and detected an approximate 2-fold induction in NCCIT-OCT4 and NANOG reporter cells at a concentration of 10 μM ( Figures S1 [this file] D and S1E). 
We chemically expanded O4I3 by replacing the CH group at the phenyl moiety with various substituents on the aryl moiety ( Table S1 [this file] ) and found that compounds induced drug-like, structure-dependent activations in NCCIT-OCT4 cells ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] D). 
Functional annotation and enrichment analysis of DNA microarray in O4I3-treated hPSCs showed that O4I3 (10 nM) promoted hPSC homeostasis and repressed cellular differentiation ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] E and S2 [this file] A). qRT-PCR results confirmed that O4I3 stabilized or slightly increased the expression of pluripotency-associated genes (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, and NODAL) and suppressed differentiation-related gene expression (GATA4, GATA6, PAX6, and SOX7) ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] F). Cellular viability of hPSCs was increased up to 4-fold at low nanomolar concentrations of O4I3 when compared with cells treated with Rock inhibitor (Y-27632) ( Figure S2 [this file] B), a small molecule able to increase hPSC survival ( Watanabe et al., 2007 [rid=bib44] ). Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis confirmed that O4I3 (10 nM) supports pluripotency during the maintenance of hPSCs after at least 30 passages under feeder-free conditions as shown by the expression of TRA-1-81 and OCT4 ( Figure S2 [this file] C). In addition, zolpidem also promoted the maintenance of iPSCs at a concentration of 10 μM ( Figure S2 [this file] B). 
Analyzing the effects of O4I3 on HFs, we detected the activation of reprogramming-associated genes at the mRNA level ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] A, 2B, and S3 [this file] A), which included an approximately 10-fold induction of OCT4 (∼0.1% versus in hPSCs) and NANOG (∼1% versus hPSCs) and an about 100-fold increase of SOX2 (∼1% versus hPSCs) and CDH1 (∼10% versus hPSCs). 
For this, the following two HF cell lines resistant to OSKM-mediated reprogramming were selected: (1) the HFF-LTR7-EGFP cell line (at passage >40), which expresses EGFP under the control of the LTR7 promoter, known to be activated during reprogramming ( Wang et al., 2014 [rid=bib42] ), and (2) HF4, isolated from a patient sample ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] C). iPSC-like colonies appeared in both cases in the presence of O4I3 ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] C and 2D) as well as in the presence of zolpidem at a concentration of 10 μM ( Figure S3 [this file] B). 
More than 95% of new hiPSCs co-expressed TRA-1-60 and E-Cadherin, as well as TRA-1-81 and OCT4 analyzed by FACS ( Figure S3 [this file] C). Comparative DNA microarray data showed that pluripotency-associated genes (Pou5F1 encoding OCT4, CDH1 encoding E-Cadherin, EPCAM, and DNMT3B) were highly expressed in hiPSC_1 and hiPSC_2, whereas fibroblast-related genes (CDH2, TWIST1, TWIST2, and SNAI2) were suppressed ( Figure S4 [this file] A). Visualization of global gene expression profiles by both scatterplots and heatmap shows a higher similarity of gene expression patterns between the newly generated hiPSCs and hPSCs (as positive controls) when compared with that of HF ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] H and S4 [this file] B). Moreover, differentiated hiPSCs showed expression of markers of mesoderm (T, SLUG, and SNAI1), ectoderm (PAX6, Nestin, and Tuj1), and endoderm (AFP, FOXA2, and SOX17) ( Figures S4 [this file] C and S4D) using respective standard protocols, which further confirmed the pluripotency properties of the new hiPSCs. 
More than 30% of them were found to be involved in epigenetic modification and chromatin remodeling ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] B and S5 [this file] A), for example, OCT4 (POU5F1), LIN28, MYCN, KIFs, DNMT3B, HDAC2, TET1, EZH2, and JARID2, which are of importance in somatic reprogramming and maintenance of pluripotency ( Apostolou and Hochedlinger, 2013 [rid=bib1] , Mikkelsen et al., 2008 [rid=bib19] ). Gene enrichment analysis on RNA sequencing also showed that the top signaling pathways regulated by O4I3 in HFs included regulation of organismal process, system development and embryo implantation, as well as cell differentiation ( Figure S5 [this file] A) 
We found that O4I3 significantly repressed six of these nine genes, including DOT1L ( Figure S5 [this file] B). 
We could not observe a significant difference between two cell lines, as determined by FACS analysis ( Figure S5 [this file] C). Chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR results in two reprogrammable fibroblasts (HF1 and HF2) and in two reprogramming-resistant fibroblasts (HF3 and HF4) showed that OSKM was sufficient to induce abundant occupation of H3K4Me3 at the promoter of OCT4 in HF1 and HF2 in a comparable manner to those in iPSCs, while producing 1,000- to 10,000-fold less in reprogramming-resistant cells ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] C and S5 [this file] D). Analysis on the global level of H3K4Me3 by immunocytochemistry showed the increase of H3K4Me3 upon O4I3 treatment ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] D and S5 [this file] E). Accordingly, we found the reduction of global H3K9Me3 posterior to H3K4Me3 activation ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] E and S5 [this file] F). 
As expected, zolpidem protected H3K4 methylation and inhibited the expression of both KDM5 and KDM4 at micromolar concentrations ( Figure S6 [this file] A). We detected the induction of OCT4, SOX2, and E-Cadherin expression in JIB-04-treated HFs ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] D and S6 [this file] B). 
KDM5B showed a similar expression pattern to OCT4 and NANOG, whereas KDM5A behaved oppositely ( Figure S6 [this file] C). In the case of KDM5D, the difference was not significant and KDM5C remained unaffected between ESC and oocyte ( Figure S6 [this file] C). We further compared the expression of KDM5A-5D in fibroblasts, reprogrammed fibroblasts by OSKM, iPSCs, and NCCIT ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] E and S7 [this file] A). KDM5A was preferentially expressed in reprogramming-resistant fibroblasts, whereas KDM5B was more pluripotency related ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] E), which was in agreement with previous gene expression profiling data ( Figure S7 [this file] B) ( Takahashi et al., 2014 [rid=bib36] ), as well as immunoblotting results ( Figure S7 [this file] C). As JIB-04 also inhibits KDM4 and KDM6 demethylases, we repressed the expression of KDM5A-D using RNA interference (small interfering RNA [siRNA]) and found significantly higher OCT4 reporter activity in NCCIT-OCT4 cells ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] F), as well as higher mRNA levels of OCT4 and SOX2 in HFs in the absence of KDM5A and KDM5D expression, but not in KDM5B and KDM5C knockdown cells ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] G and S7 [this file] D). Notably, the effects of KDM5D repression were found to be less significant when compared with those of KDM5A knockdown, most probably due to the various transfection efficiencies ( Figure S7 [this file] D). Moreover, knockdown of KDM5A also increased the global levels of H3K4Me3 with or without OSKM ( Figure S7 [this file] E). Overexpression of KDM5A compromised these effects caused by KDM5A inhibition (either O4I3 or JIB-04) in NCCIT-OCT4 reporter cells in a concentration-dependent manner, as well as in HEK-OCT4 reporter cells ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] H, S7 [this file] F, and S7G). Conversely, cells were resistant to KDM5A chemical inhibitors in the absence of KDM5A expression ( Figure S7 [this file] G). Of note, at concentrations of 10 and 100 nM, O413 treatment alone showed higher OCT4 levels when compared with that of O4I3 combined with siRNA-mediated KDM5A inhibition ( Figure S7 [this file] G), which may be due to the insufficient knockdown efficiency ( Figure S7 [this file] D). 
Moreover, KDM5A siRNA increased the global level of H3K4Me3 in a dose-dependent manner ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] E and S7 [this file] E). 
Transient suppression of KDM5A expression with either KDM5A siRNA or chemical inhibition mimicked the effect of O4I3 to either increase the episomal-based reprogramming efficiency in normal fibroblasts or to facilitate the formation of ESC-like TRA-1-60-positive colonies in reprogramming-resistant fibroblasts ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] F and S8 [this file] A). These ESC-like colonies could be isolated and expanded to establish stable hiPSC cell lines with the expression of pluripotency markers, like OCT4, SOX2, E-Cadherin, TRA-1-60, and TRA-1-81, and full differentiation potential ( Figures S8 [this file] B and S8C).

Inserts show zooms of example cytokine-receptor interactions; for network with labels, see Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] . 
This library contained 46 proteins from the ImmuneXpresso search including both TNFα and (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). We quantified a total of 4790 proteins with an overall median Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). To visualize response similarities between stimuli, we constructed a network of the number of differentially abundant proteins and overlap per stimulus (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). There was no significant enrichment for module 4 (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 3b, c [this file] ). 
See Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] for non-summarized network. 
Initially, we performed a concentration range of TNFα and IFNγ separately and observed similar proteomic profiles for stimulation at 10 and 100 ng/ml (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
Principal component analysis showed high overlap with HUVECs in Rombouts et al. and BOECs and pulmonary ECs in Long et al. (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). However, the correlation of transcriptome signatures also highlighted study-induced variation (Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] ). Relative expression levels of key EC genes as well as TNFα and IFNγ receptors were similar between the majority of EC types (Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). 
This resulted in a network containing 2306 interactions, revealing 9 high-density hubs summarized in biological processes: “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ”, “ ” and “ ” (Fig. 5d [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, in contrast to MHCI proteins, which were detected abundantly on the protein level, we were only able to detect and in separate LFQ workflow experiments (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). MHCI showed a clear distribution over the cell membrane, also in steady-state condition (Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] ) and in line with both transcriptome and protein data, was only observed in IFNγ stimulated conditions. 
Time-dependent changes were most apparent in the secretome as proteins were excreted into the supernatant over time (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ) and we observed limited protein changes due to stimulation at early timepoints (30 m and 4 h). 
Variability in donor-to-donor responses is a point of concern as well , but throughout this study, we employed BOECs derived from 19 different donors (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ) and observed consistent inflammatory signatures throughout. 
For all experiments, except the multi-omics and secretome experiments, three different pools of three unique BOEC donors (mixed sexes and ages) were used (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
All recombinant human cytokines used for stimulations were obtained from Peprotech (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
For reproducibility, ECs from 19 different donors were randomly combined in different pools of three donors (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ).",pdf,Multi-omics delineation of cytokine-induced endothelial inflammatory states,XML,,,,,,,

The top 10 differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the 7 cell states are presented as a heatmap (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] & Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM3] ). This precipitous transcriptomic response is in keeping with an acute cellular stress response and coincided with a transient rise in IL-6 and IL-8 secretion independent of transcription (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). Analysis of independent EnSC cultures confirmed that decidualization polarizes cells into two subsets (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Known decidual stress defence genes (e.g. , and ) were enriched in S5 (designated DC) whereas genes involved in oxidative stress signalling and cellular senescence, including , and , prevailed in S6 (designated snDC) (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). Notably, on day 6, the proportion of DC and snDC was 78% and 13%, respectively (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). Withdrawal of the decidualization signal on day 8 elicited a further transcriptional change (S7), which was accounted for by partial de-differentiation of >95% of DC (Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM3] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
To test this hypothesis, uNK cells were isolated from the supernatants of freshly cultured EnSC using magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) and the purity and viability of cells confirmed by flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] , dasatinib also markedly reduced SAβG activity and selectively inhibited CLU whereas the effect on sST2 secretion was minimal, thus recapitulating the actions of uNK cells. 
Following quality control (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), -SNE analysis assigned 2847 cells to 5 clusters colour-coded to indicate the day of biopsy (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] ). EpC2 are ciliated epithelial cells found interspersed throughout endometrial glands (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). The abundance of various cell types and subsets in each biopsy is tabulated in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] . 
Congruency was defined as the sum of correlation coefficients of >1 or <−1 for positively and negatively co-regulated genes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ). 
As shown in Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] , / cells are characterized by the expression of multiple decidual TF and stress-resistance genes whereas a stress gene signature was prominent in / cells (Supplementary Data 8 [rid=MOESM3] ).",docx,Recurrent pregnancy loss is associated with a pro-senescent decidual response during the peri-implantation window,XML,,,,,,,

By day 2 of decidualization, most cells had transitioned to S3, which differed from S2 by 898 DEG (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). Withdrawal of the decidualization signal on day 8 elicited a further transcriptional change (S7), which was accounted for by partial de-differentiation of >95% of DC (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] and Supplementary Table 1 [rid=MOESM1] ). 
We used k-means cluster analysis to identify networks of co-regulated genes across the decidual pathway (Supplementary Data 3 [this file] ). Interestingly, this network is enriched in gene ontology terms ‘secreted’ (Benjamini adjusted = 3.7 × 10 , modified Fisher Exact test) and ‘type I interferon signalling pathway’ (Benjamini adjusted = 1.4 × 10 , modified Fisher Exact test) (Supplementary Data 4 [this file] ), both canonical features of cellular senescence . 
Clusters were designated based on canonical marker genes as endothelial cells (EC; = 141), epithelial cells (EpC; = 395), immune cells (IC; = 352) and EnSC ( = 1943) (Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Data 5 [this file] ). Based on CIBERSORT analysis, the remaining immune populations were identified as naive B-cells (IC1), monocytes (IC2), and macrophage/dendritic cells (IC3) (Fig. 4d [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Data 6 [this file] ). 
Progression from LH + 8 to LH + 10 was associated with altered expression of 518 genes in EnSC (Supplementary Data 7 [this file] ), 49% of which are also part of the 7 co-regulated gene networks in vitro ( < 10 , hypergeometric test).

We found that SENP1 is specifically reduced in hepatocytes during NAFLD (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). we then generated hepatocyte-specific SENP1-knockout mice by crossing mice with ( ) Tg mice to elucidate the function of SENP1 in NAFLD. The efficient deletion of SENP1 in hepatocytes was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of whole liver and isolated primary hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d [this file] ). 
Knockdown of SENP1 has been found in a focused genome-wide siRNA screen to sensitize to RIPK1-dependent cell death in mouse fibroblast L929 cells (Z-score = −3.88) (Supplementary Fig. 1e [this file] ), suggesting a potential role of SENP1 in suppressing RIPK1 activation. We detected RIPK1 activation as determined by substantial amount of p-S166 RIPK1 positive cells in liver sections of ; mice and increased p-S166 RIPK1 in primary hepatocytes isolated from 8 months old ; mice (Fig. 1g [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1f [this file] ). The death of hepatocytes is mainly apoptosis as determined by increased levels of cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) in SENP1-deficient hepatocytes, which is blocked in ; ; hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1f [this file] ). However, we did not detect apparent signal of p-T231/S232 RIPK3, the hallmark of necroptosis , by immunoblotting in SENP1-deficient hepatocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1f [this file] ). 
We found increased inflammatory CD45 cell infiltration in ; mice at early stage (3 months of age) (Supplementary Fig. 1g [this file] ). Hepatic mRNA expression of inflammatory genes, including , , and , were increased in 3-month-old ; mice compared with WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. 1h [this file] ). The gene transcriptional patterns from the livers of 3-month-old ; mice showed dramatic changes compared to that of mice (Supplementary Fig. 1i [this file] ). Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that hepatic SENP1 deficiency led to significant increase in the expression levels of those genes involved in mediating inflammatory response, such as TNFR1 signaling and NF-κB pathway (genes including , , , and ), and apoptotic process (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 1j [this file] ). In addition, multiple homeostatic and metabolic pathways were downregulated in ; mice (Supplementary Fig. 1k [this file] ). Strikingly, the up-regulation of these pro-inflammatory genes, including , , , , and were restored to that of control levels in ; ; livers and primary hepatocytes (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 1l [this file] ). 
We found that ; mice displayed steatosis, as determined by oil red O (ORO) staining, as early as at 3-month of age (Supplementary Fig. 1m [this file] ), and remained elevated at 8 months old (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] ). The deposition of lipid in ; livers and primary hepatocytes was further confirmed by measuring hepatic concentrations of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 1n [this file] ). Interestingly, inhibition of RIPK1 in ; ; mice strongly suppressed steatosis (Fig. 2d, e [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 1n [this file] ). 
The fibrillary collagen deposition in the livers of ; mice was confirmed by Masson’s trichrome staining (MTS) (Fig. 2f [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 1o [this file] ). 
After AAV infection for 2 months (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ), we detected RIPK1 activation in livers of ; ; -C599S (SENP1-C599S) mice, but not that of SENP1-WT mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ). Consistently, SENP1-C599S but not SENP1-WT livers showed CC3 cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ). SENP1-C599S livers also showed elevated inflammatory cytokine production than that of SENP1-WT livers (Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] ). SENP1-C599S but not SENP1-WT livers display apparent steatosis (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). 
Consistent with previous study , SENP1 knockdown (KD) greatly sensitized cells to RDA (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ), which was also confirmed in cells expressing SENP1-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). The death of SENP1-KD MEFs induced by TNFα/5z7 was fully protected by RIPK1 kinase inhibitor necrostatin-1s (Nec-1s) (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). SENP1 KD enhanced RIPK1 activation, as shown by increased activation biomarker p-S166 RIPK1, and apoptosis as shown by increased levels of the cleaved-caspase-3 (CC3) (Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ). 
We found that SENP1 KD has minor effect on NF-κB and MAPK pathway activation in TNFα-treated MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 3e [this file] ). Interestingly, SENP1 KD sensitized to cell death induced by TNFα alone, a condition that cannot induce the death of wild-type (WT) MEFs (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 3f, g [this file] ). 
Cycloheximide (CHX) blocks the translation downstream of NF-κB pathway activated by TNFα and promotes RIPK1-independent apoptosis (RIA) of WT MEFs when treated with TNFα, which cannot be blocked by RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). In contrast, SENP1-KD MEFs showed greater levels of cell death in response to TNFα/CHX, which was blunted by treatment with Nec-1s (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). Furthermore, TNFα/CHX-treated SENP1-KD MEFs, but not WT MEFs, induced p-S166 RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). 
We found that SENP1 KD greatly sensitized cells to TNFα/CHX/zVAD-induced necroptosis (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). The increased sensitivity of SENP1-KD MEFs to necroptosis was also marked by the increased levels of the necroptotic biomarkers p-S166 RIPK1, p-T231/S232 RIPK3, and p-S345 MLKL relative to that of WT MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] ). Consistent with increased activation of necroptosis, we found that SENP1-KD MEFs showed more necrosome formation than that of WT MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ). 
We detected substantial increases in activated p-S166 RIPK1 cells throughout fetal liver (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). 
Compared to WT fetal livers, fetal livers showed markedly elevated expression of genes involved in apoptotic process and immune response, which is in line with the increased levels of cell death and pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in fetal livers (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c [this file] ). mRNA levels can be upregulated during RIPK1-dependent cell death in certain cells . The elevated expression of mRNA levels was reduced in ; fetal livers (Fig. 3l [rid=Fig3] ). embryos have poor blood vessel development and anemia ; consistently, fetal livers showed downregulation of multiple blood vessel development pathways (Supplementary Fig. 5d [this file] ). Interestingly, the gene expression abnormalities of 278 genes (~30% genes upregulated in relative to WT), including these involved in apoptotic process and immune response, were restored to WT levels by genetic inhibition of RIPK1 in ; fetal livers (Fig. 3m, n [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] ). 
However, we were unable to obtain viable ; mice despite the prevention of cell death in fetal livers of these mice (Supplementary Fig. 5f [this file] ). Similarly, RIPK1-D138N mutation does not alter the downregulation of genes that are involved in blood vessel development in embryos (Supplementary Fig. 5g, h [this file] ). We found that RIPK1-D138N mutation could not rescue the deficient EPO production in ; embryos (Supplementary Fig. 5i [this file] ). Defective rescue of the expression of EPO and its receptor EPOR in ; embryos were further confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR (Supplementary Fig. 5j [this file] ). 
To explore this possibility, we conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of SUMOylated proteins in WT and SENP1-KD MEFs stimulated by TNFα for 5 min (Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ). 
We then performed in vitro SUMOylation assays in which RIPK1 was purified from HEK293T cells and pretreated with pan-deubiquitylase USP2 to completely remove ubiquitination to avoid its interference with SUMOylation (Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). 
We found that ectopically expressed RIPK1 was co-immunoprecipitated with SENP1 (Supplementary Fig. 6c [this file] ). In contrast, A20 does not interact with SENP1 (Supplementary Fig. 6d [this file] ). We found that the intermediate domain (ID) of RIPK1 was mainly required for the interaction of RIPK1 and SENP1 (Supplementary Fig. 6e [this file] ). Similarly, we found that the N-terminus, but not the C-terminus of SENP1 interacted with RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 6f [this file] ). 
In cell SUMOylation assays using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) purification showed that WT SENP1, but not its catalytically inactive mutant, significantly reduced the SUMOylation levels of exogenous RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). 
We found that RIPK1 SUMOylation is substantially increased in the livers of individuals with NASH than that in the nonsteatotic controls (Supplementary Fig. 6h [this file] ). Consistently, RIPK1 SUMOylation is also increased in the livers of mice with NAFLD than that in control mice (Supplementary Fig. 6i [this file] ). 
To determine the relevant lysine(s) that can be modified by SUMO in the RIPK1 protein, we conducted a mass spectrometry analysis of SUMOylated RIPK1 by using in cell SUMOylation assays, in which T90R-mutated SUMO3 was exogenously expressed to promote modified substrates that when digested with trypsin produce remnants of two amino acids that can be detected by MS to identify SUMO conjugation sites (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b [this file] ). We found that overexpressing SUMO3-T90R and Ubc9 induced the SUMOylation of RIPK1 at multiple lysine residues with a conserved Lys550 (K550, mouse RIPK1) and K132 residues being the main SUMOylation sites of RIPK1 (Fig. 6a [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] ). Mutation of K550 to Ala reduced SUMOylation of exogenously expressed RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 7d [this file] ). In contrast, mutation of both K550 and K132 to Ala did not offer additional reduction of SUMOylation levels of RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 7d [this file] ), thus RIPK1 is dominantly SUMOylated at K550. 
To address a requirement for the SUMOylation of RIPK1 in controlling its activity and cell death, we reconstituted RIPK1 and SENP1 double-deficient MEFs with WT RIPK1 and K550A mutant RIPK1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7e [this file] ). Moreover, disruption of RIPK1 SUMOylation by K550A mutation increased the recruitment of A20, while decreased the recruitment of LUBAC into TNF-RSC in TNFα-stimulated SENP1-KD cells (Fig. 6d [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 7f [this file] ). 
We found that PIAS1 was present in RIPK1 immunoprecipitates when co-expressing PIAS1 and RIPK1 in HEK293T cells (Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). Similar to SENP1, we found that PIAS1 also interacted with the intermediate domain (ID) of RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 8b [this file] ). 
To examine whether PIAS1 SUMOylates RIPK1, we performed in cell SUMOylation assays using Ni-NTA purification, which showed that PIAS1 significantly increased the SUMOylation of exogenous RIPK1 (Supplementary Fig. 8c [this file] ). We next tested whether the SUMOylation of RIPK1 in TNF-RSC of TNFα-stimulated SENP1-KD cells was mediated by PIAS1, we performed a tandem IP of TNF-RSC to isolate SUMOylated RIPK1 in SENP1 and PIAS1 double knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 8d [this file] ). We found that PIAS1 knockdown reduced RIPK1 SUMOylation in TNF-RSC of SENP1-KD cells that were stimulated with TNFα (Supplementary Fig. 8e [this file] ). 
We found that PIAS1 was also recruited to the TNF-RSC within minutes of TNFα stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 8f [this file] ). Consistent with the interaction of PIAS1 and RIPK1, the recruitment of PIAS1 into TNF-RSC was totally blocked in MEFs stimulated by TNFα (Supplementary Fig. 8f [this file] ). We found that the recruitment of SENP1 in TNF-RSC is reduced in PIAS1-KO cells when compared to that in PIAS1-WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 8g [this file] ), while the recruitment of PIAS1 is not altered in SENP1-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 8h [this file] ), suggesting that PIAS1 is at least partially required for the recruitment of SENP1. 
We found that PIAS1 knockdown dramatically reduced cell death in SENP1-KD cells that were treated with TNFα (Supplementary Fig. 8i [this file] ). PIAS1 knockdown also inhibited RIPK1 activation and the levels of CC3 (Supplementary Fig. 8j [this file] ). 
We used 2 months old mice, when spontaneous liver damage are not observed in ; mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] ). After LPS injection for 4 h, we observed substantial liver damage in ; mice compared to littermate controls as determined by ALT, AST levels and histology stains (Supplementary Fig. 9b, c [this file] ). Consistently, ; livers displayed increased number of TUNEL and p-S166 RIPK1 cells compared to livers after LPS stimulation (Supplementary Fig. 9d [this file] ). In addition, the mRNA levels of inflammatory cytokines, including , , , , , and were substantially higher in ; livers than that in livers (Supplementary Fig. 9e [this file] ). Strikingly, RIPK1-D138N mutation largely reduced the liver damage and inflammation in ; ; mice (Supplementary Fig. 9b–e [this file] ). 
In primary mouse hepatocytes, SENP1 deficiency substantially increased RIPK1 SUMOylation levels after exposure to palmitic acid (PA), which \was performed to mimic in vivo NAFLD pathologies (Supplementary Fig. 9f [this file] ). We also observed substantial cell death in SENP1-deficient hepatocytes treated with PA (Supplementary Fig. 9g [this file] ). Consistently, RIPK1 activation as determined by its S166 phosphorylation, and apoptosis as shown by increased levels of CC3 are increased in ; hepatocytes treated with PA (Supplementary Fig. 9h [this file] ). In addition, the apoptosis of ; hepatocytes induced by PA was fully protected by RIPK1-D138N mutation (Supplementary Fig. 9g, h [this file] ). 
H&E staining revealed that the hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation were markedly aggravated in HFD-fed ; mice compared with that of HFD-fed mice (Fig. 7d [rid=Fig7] ), which was further confirmed by ORO staining and measuring hepatic concentrations of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) (Fig. 7e [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 9i [this file] ). In comparison, the hepatic steatosis and lipid accumulation in the liver of HFD-fed ; ; mice were considerably lower (Fig. 7d, e [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 9i [this file] ).",pdf,SENP1 prevents steatohepatitis by suppressing RIPK1-driven apoptosis and inflammation,XML,,,,,,,

This result is supported by the number of unique NCOR complex peptides obtained as well as the low representation of these proteins in databases of common mass spectrometry (MS) contaminants (Table S1 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, CDK2AP1 enrichment was seen only with CHD4‐C but not with CHD4‐N and CHD4‐M (Figs 5D [rid=febs16112-fig-0005] and S2 [this file] ), indicating that CDK2AP1 only recognises the C‐terminal half of CHD4 (Fig. 5A [rid=febs16112-fig-0005] ). 
We therefore examined the six missense mutations in CHD4 within or adjacent to this region, which could potentially affect the interaction of CHD4 with either ADNP or GATAD2B (Fig. S3 [this file] A). Four of these mutations (D1867N, P1879S, R1890C and N1891D) had no impact on CHD4 interaction with either GATAD2B or ADNP (D1867N is exemplified in Fig. S3 [this file] B, Lane 2). However, a reduction in CHD4‐C interaction with full‐length ADNP was observed, when compared to WT CHD4‐C (Fig. S3 [this file] B). With regard to GATAD2B, only CHD4‐C showed a clear effect on the interaction when compared to WT (Fig. S3 [this file] C). 
Further investigation of the number of unique peptides detected for HDAC2 vs HDAC1 in CDK2AP1 PD‐MS was 6 to 2, respectively (Fig. S4 [this file] A). We conclude that this observation is linked to the assembly and architecture and consequently interaction of the HDAC1 with the CDK2AP1/NuRD complex (Fig. S4 [this file] B,C).",zip,Unique protein interaction networks define the chromatin remodelling module of the NuRD complex,XML,,,,,,,

However, at the primary protein sequence level, all the XIP isoforms, even the largest XIP-L, had an identity of no more than 25% with the animal MDC1 proteins only within the BRCT-like domain(s) (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ), without any significant similarity found in the rest of these proteins (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
In addition to the above retriever peptides p1 and p2, we synthesized another peptide p3, in which S139 was replaced by glutamic acid, mimicking the negatively-charged phosphorylated serine (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Our ppd experiment showed that both dual-BRCT-like domains (XIP-L and -M), but not single-BRCT-like domain (XIP-S), specifically interacted with peptide p2 but not p1 (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ), indicating that the second insignificant BRCT domain is indispensable to the first RTT107_BRCT_5 domain in γ-H2A.X recognition. 
Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) result showed that NM_001340429.1 (NM_001340429.1) was the major transcript isoform of in all the examined plant organs (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] , b [this file] ). The transcript levels of three isoforms were not significantly affected by exogenous replicative or genotoxic stresses (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). Again, the full-length XIP-M interacted specifically with both p2 and p3 retrievers, but not p1 (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ), suggesting that dual-BRCT-like domain contributes to the specificity of XIP recognition to γ-H2A.X. 
We expressed YFP-fused XIP-M in mesophyll protoplasts (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). After longer BLM treatment (3 h), the immunostaining assay revealed that, in contrast to the largely dispersed distribution under mock condition (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ), the XIP signals became focused and co-localized well with all the observed BLM-induced γ-H2A.X foci in DAPI-stained nuclei, although with a slight diffusion around (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] ). 
This mutant was verified as a functional knock-out mutant by RT-qPCR and RACE analyses (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] , b). In consistence, we observed smaller meristem zone in root tips (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). Both HU and BLM treatments significantly inhibited seedling growth, the root meristem zones within root tips, and primary root elongation (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] a– c [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). Till now, the biological significance of each transcript isoform cannot be fully elucidated (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Therefore, we cloned the entire genomic DNA of (including 2 kb of promoter and 1 kb of terminator of the longest ) and transformed it into (named as in ), which complemented the growth inhibition of and recovered the WT-like root meristem zone (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] a– d [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
After normalization, those genes with both fold change of transcript level ≥2 and -value ≤0.05 were considered as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ). Among them, we noticed that the DEG number in after BLM treatment ( -BLM/ -Mock) was obviously smaller (338 up- and 144 downregulated genes) when compared to those in WT after BLM treatment (WT-BLM/WT-Mock, 771 up- and 742 downregulated genes), suggesting that the transcriptional response to BLM challenge may be less severe in mutant when compared with that in WT (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ), which was in line with our quantitative RT-qPCR examination (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ), and was further supported by the principal component analysis (PCA) (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
In the most enriched GO category ‘response to stress (GO: 0006950)’, we noticed that 132 out of the 264 upregulated DEGs (50%) in mutant were overlapped with those in WT-HU/WT-Mock and WT-BLM/WT-Mock (Supplementary Fig. 12 [this file] ), supporting that -depletion partially mimics the WT plants under replication and/or genotoxin stresses in activating diverse responsive genes. 
We found 37 upregulated DPPs in WT-BLM/WT-Mock in this study, including the best-studied γ-H2A.X (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] ). 
Our quantitative parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) analysis confirmed the significant activation of γ-H2A.X (H2A.X-S139) after BLM treatment (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] and Data 6 [this file0] ). Besides, Ser or Thr residue within proteins implicated in cell cycle progression and cell death were found significantly hyper-phosphorylated in mutant compared to WT after BLM treatment (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] and Supplementary Data 6 [this file0] ). 
The difference was much more obvious and significant after BLM treatment (Supplementary Fig. 14a [this file] ). 
In comparison, the root apical meristem of mutants showed sporadic cell death even under mock growth condition, and more PI-stained cell death was found under BLM treatment (Supplementary Figs . 14b [this file] and 15 [this file] ), indicating that is required to impede spontaneous and DSB-induced cell death in vivo. Complete gene sequence ( in ) complemented the phenotype of mutants in plant cell death and genomic instability (Supplementary Fig. 14a [this file] , b [this file] ), indicating the lose-of-function of was the cause of these phenotypes. 
Similarly, the [Col] also showed more cell death phenotype at both mock and BLM conditions when compared to WT [Col] (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 15 [this file] ). 
We also verified their interaction via bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiment (Supplementary Fig. 16 [this file] ). 
While the precise molecular function of XIP remains to be determined, based on the phenotype and the protein data showing XIP can interact with γ-H2A.X and RAD51, we propose a possible model for how XIP could contribute to HR and the maintenance of genome stability (Supplementary Fig. 17 [this file] ).",docx,Arabidopsis γ-H2A.X-INTERACTING PROTEIN participates in DNA damage response and safeguards chromatin stability,XML,,,,,,,

The capture of ZNF282 by ZNF398 attracted our attention, as both of these KZFPs contain a DUF3669 domain, and interactions between DUF3669‐containing KZFPs were previously recorded (Gao , 2008 [rid=embj2018101220-bib-0014] ; Kang & Shin, 2015 [rid=embj2018101220-bib-0026] ; Huttlin , 2017 [rid=embj2018101220-bib-0019] ) ( Appendix Fig S2 [this file] ). 
Those found together with KAP1 related to nucleosome formation and modification or involved other TRIM family proteins or cytoplasmic chaperones sharing subcellular localizations with their baits as for ZNF546, ZNF304, and ZNF283 (Fig 1 [rid=embj2018101220-fig-0001] A, Appendix Fig S3A [this file] ). 
Several of these unique preys pointed to RNA‐related functions such as unique partners detected with the eIF3‐associated ZKSCAN4 and ZNF746 or the RNA‐processing paraspeckle‐forming proteins PSPC1, NONO, and SFPQ for ZNF213, corroborated by their similar sub‐nuclear localization patterns in these structures (Hata , 2008 [rid=embj2018101220-bib-0016] ) ( Appendix Fig S3B [this file] ). 
Except for the MER51A/E‐binding ZNF20, TE‐binding KZFPs displaying unique interactomes were enriched over LINEs, which often recruited several of them (Imbeault , 2017 [rid=embj2018101220-bib-0021] ) ( Appendix Fig S4 [this file] ). 
For some, this might have been due to lack of expression of their functional partners in 293T cells, although these KZFPs themselves did not display abnormally low levels in these cells ( Appendix Fig S5A [this file] ). In contrast, more than half of the KZFPs associated with more than three unique interactors segregated in a small cluster characterized by a higher expression in testis and blood according to the GTEx database (The GTEx consortium, 2013 [rid=embj2018101220-bib-0062] ) ( Appendix Fig S5B [this file] ).",pdf,The interactome of,XML,,,,,,,

See also Figure S1 [href=this file] , and Table S1 [href=#SD2] .
PKA in its inactive form is a tetramer of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits; dissociation of the regulatory subunits upon binding to cyclic AMP (cAMP) results in the activation of the kinase. , which codes for the catalytic subunit α of PKA (PKA-Cα) identified in the MIBs assays, is the dominant catalytic subunit expressed in SCLC ( Figure 1D [href=#F1] , Figure S1C [href=this file] , and Table S1 [href=#SD2] ). Tissue microarrays probed with an antibody recognizing phosphorylated CREB (pCREB, cAMP Response Binding Element factor 1, CREB), a well-known target of PKA, suggested activation of the PKA/CREB pathway in 17.5% of tumors ( Figure S1D [href=this file] ).
Switching from PKA-Cα to PKA-Cα at the time of cancer initiation in TKO; mice ( Figure S2A [href=this file] - C [href=this file] ) led to a significant inhibition of SCLC development compared to control TKO mice ( Figure 2A [href=#F2] - C [href=#F2] ).

See also Figure S2 [href=this file] .
SCLC cell lines derived from PKA-Cα TKO tumors showed decreased survival in culture compared to TKO cells ( Figure S2D [href=this file] ). Knockdown of PKA-Cα in KP1 ( mutant) and KP11 ( mutant) cell lines also led to decreased growth and increased apoptosis ( Figure S2E [href=this file] - H [href=this file] ). Similar phenotypes were observed with allografts from KP1 cells ( Figure S2I [href=this file] - J [href=this file] ). Indeed, knockdown of PKA-Cα in these cells led to an increase in apoptosis and a significant inhibition of tumor growth in mice ( Figure 2H [href=#F2] - J [href=#F2] and Figure S2K [href=this file] ).
We found that treatment with the PP2A inhibitor (PP2Ai) cantharidin inhibited PP2A activity ( Figure S3A [href=this file] ) and enhanced the phosphorylation of PKA substrates in SCLC cells, including VASP (Vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein) and CREB ( Figure 3A [href=#F3] - B [href=#F3] ). This was prevented by pre-treatment with a PKA inhibitor (PKAi) ( Figure 3B [href=#F3] ), supporting a model in which PP2A activity counteracts PKA activity in SCLC cells. is the most highly expressed PP2A α subunit in human SCLC, and SCLC cells are dependent on expression for their growth in the DepMap dataset ( Figure S3B [href=this file] - C [href=this file] ). Treatment of SCLC cells with two independent small molecule activators of PP2A (or SMAPs), which act via inhibition of PPP2R1A ( Grossman et al., 2017 [href=#R27] ; Kastrinsky et al., 2015 [href=#R42] ; Sangodkar et al., 2017 [href=#R82] ), suppressed PKA substrate phosphorylation and induced apoptosis in SCLC cells ( Figure 3C [href=#F3] and Figure S3D [href=this file] - E [href=this file] ). PP2A has multiple targets in cells, and we found that SMAP treatment also had potent effects on c-MYC expression and mTOR activity in cells ( Figure S3F [href=this file] ), indicating that PKA signaling inhibition may represent only a fraction of the effects of PP2A activation in SCLC cells. Nevertheless, treatment with the SMAP-1154 tool compound as a single agent led to suppression of tumor growth in NJH29 SCLC xenografts ( Figure S3G [href=this file] ), with decreased phosphorylation of PKA substrates ( Figure S3H [href=this file] ). Treatment with a more bioavailable compound (SMAP DT-061) ( Sangodkar et al., 2017 [href=#R82] ) had a potent inhibitory effect with induction of apoptosis in a different SCLC xenograft model (NCI-H69 cells) in combination with chemotherapy treatment (cisplatin) ( Figure 3D [href=#F3] - F [href=#F3] and Figure S3I [href=this file] - J [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S3 [href=this file] .
We found Gαs (encoded by to be the most highly expressed G-protein α subunits in human SCLC ( Figure S4A [href=this file] ). In a clinical sequencing cohort of over 300 patients at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, 5 tumors had amplification of and one tumor had a known oncogenic R201C mutation in Gαs ( Landis et al., 1989 [href=#R46] ) ( Figure S4B [href=this file] ).
To test the role of Gαs in SCLC, we crossed mice to TKO mice ( Figure S4C [href=this file] ). deletion in this context ( Figure S4D [href=this file] ) led to decreased tumor development compared to TKO mice ( Figure 4A [href=#F4] - D [href=#F4] ), indicating that Gαs is required for optimal cancer initiation in this model. To next determine if Gαs activation could promote SCLC development, we crossed TKO mice to transgenic mice expressing a constitutive active form of Gαs ( allele) following Cre expression and doxycycline (Dox) treatment ( Iglesias-Bartolome et al., 2015 [href=#R34] ) ( Figure S4E [href=this file] ). TKO; mice developed both SCLC tumors and non-SCLC tumors 3.5 months after Ad-Cre instillation ( Figure S4F [href=this file] ), indicating that Gαs strongly promotes lung cancer development in this genetic context. Nevertheless, TKO; mice still developed more and larger SCLC tumors compared to TKO controls, as determined by immunostaining for the neuroendocrine marker synaptophysin (SYP) ( Figure S4G [href=this file] - I [href=this file] ). When we analyzed tumor sections from TKO and TKO; SCLC tumors, as well as TKO; SCLC tumors, we found no differences in cell death or proliferation associated with changes in Gαs activity ( Figure S4J [href=this file] - M [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S4 [href=this file] .
We expressed LAP-tagged forms (localization and affinity purification tag, LAP-tag) of PKA-Cα, PKA-Cβ, and PKA-R1A in NCI-H446 SCLC cells ( Torres et al., 2009 [href=#R97] ) and performed mass spectrometry on the eluted fractions after purification ( Figure 5A [href=#F5] and Figure S5A [href=this file] ). We found complex interactions between catalytic and regulatory PKA subunits, suggesting that loss or inhibition of a single catalytic enzyme may not fully reveal the function of PKA in SCLC cells ( Figure S5B [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S5 [href=this file] and Table S2 [href=#SD3] .
When we knocked down the PKA target CREB in murine SCLC cells, we did not observe any inhibition of SCLC cell growth in culture or in mice ( Figure S6A [href=this file] - D [href=this file] ). We selected two PDX models (NJH29 and LX102), one allograft model (derived from a TKO mouse, 5BI), and one human cell line (NCI-H82), which are representative of the diversity of molecular phenotypes in human SCLC ( Rudin et al., 2019 [href=#R78] ) ( Figure S6E [href=this file] ). As expected, recombinant active PKA (rPKA) was better able to phosphorylate substrates with ATP while rAS-PKA (PKA-Cα ) was better at using Bn-ATPγS ( Figure 6B [href=#F6] - C [href=#F6] and Figure S6F [href=this file] - G [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S6 [href=this file] , and Tables S3 [href=#SD4] - S5 [href=#SD6] .
To gain further insight into the downstream consequences of PKA activation in SCLC cells, we next performed a global phosphoproteomic analysis in NCI-H526 cells (highly dependent on PKA activity, Figure 2G [href=#F2] - I [href=#F2] ) and NCI-H69 cells (which have relatively high PKA activity, Figure S6H [href=this file] ). However, GO term analysis for the phosphoproteome affected by cAMP in both cell lines showed enrichment for a variety of pathways implicated in cell proliferation and cancer ( Tables S4 [href=#SD5] , Figure 6G [href=#F6] , and Figure S6I [href=this file] ), similar to the pathways enriched in the AS-PKA experiments. 54 PKA substrates identified using the AS-PKA approach were also identified using the global phosphoproteomic approach ( Table S5 [href=#SD6] ).
To investigate the cellular consequences of PKA activation in SCLC cells, we expressed a doxycycline-inducible version of PKA-Cα with reduced capability for inhibition by regulatory subunits (active PKA, or aPKA) ( Orellana and McKnight, 1992 [href=#R68] ) or a GFP control in human NCI-H82 and NJH29 SCLC cells, which have relatively low PKA activity when compared to other SCLC cell lines ( Figure S6H [href=this file] ). Expression of aPKA led to a moderate increase in PKA signaling and a significant increase in the growth of xenografts ( Figure 7A [href=#F7] and Figure S7A [href=this file] - D [href=this file] ). PANTHER pathway analysis on the genes downregulated in both models (P<0.05) revealed changes in various signaling pathways, including cell adhesion and cell death ( Figure S7E [href=this file] ). Analysis of the upregulated genes in aPKA-expressing tumors revealed pathways associated with neuronal and neuroendocrine features ( Figure S7F [href=this file] ). In particular, we noticed a significant up-regulation of a number of markers of SCLC cancer stem cells ( Jahchan et al., 2016 [href=#R38] ), including , and ( Table S6 [href=#SD7] , Figure 7B [href=#F7] and Figure S7G [href=this file] - H [href=this file] ).

PKA in its inactive form is a tetramer of two catalytic and two regulatory subunits; dissociation of the regulatory subunits upon binding to cyclic AMP (cAMP) results in the activation of the kinase. , which codes for the catalytic subunit α of PKA (PKA-Cα) identified in the MIBs assays, is the dominant catalytic subunit expressed in SCLC ( Figure 1D [href=#F1] , Figure S1C [href=#SD1] , and Table S1 [href=this file] ).

Primers for RT-qPCR analysis for the experiments shown in Figure 3 [href=#fig3] are listed in Table S1 [href=this file] .
Variant constructs (TRX domain SNDC to SNDG p.Cys170Gly [c.508T>G] and affected individuals’ variants p.Arg53Cys [c.157C>T] and p.Arg231Trp [c.691C>T]) were generated according to manufacturers’ procedures via the QuikChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent), wild-type purified construct dilution (10 ng/μL), and 100 ng/μL primers specified in Table S2 [href=this file] .
Sanger sequencing of wild-type and variant plasmid DNA was performed as earlier described. 31 [href=#bib31] In brief, amplification reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 μl, containing 1 × PCR buffer with Mg (Roche), 200 μM of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 1 μM forward and reverse primer (specified in Table S3 [href=this file] ), 0.1 units of Fast Start Taq DNA polymerase (Roche), and 25 ng genomic DNA.
Transfection was also stable after 48 and 72 h ( Figure S3 [href=this file] ).
The clinical features observed in all 14 affected individuals, in whom we detected variants, have been summarized in Table 1 [href=#tbl1] , and full clinical and MRI descriptions are available in the Supplemental Note [href=this file] , Table S4 [href=#mmc2] , and Figure 1 [href=#fig1] .
P indicates the code of the probands as used in Tables 1 [href=#tbl1] and S4 [href=this file] .
To determine which of the alleles was still expressed, we performed allele-specific RT-qPCR (primers specified in Table S1 [href=this file] ).
Individual reads of each transcript are shown in Figure S1 [href=this file] .
Compared to other TMX family members, only is expressed steadily from week 8 throughout fetal brain development, even increasing during postnatal life (information about mRNA expression during human brain development was retrieved from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (see Web Resources [href=#app4] ); Figure S3 [href=this file] ).
Immunocytochemistry of exogenous TMX2 localized the protein to the MAM through co-localization with the marker calnexin (CNX) ( Figure S4 [href=this file] A) and in the vicinity of the mitochondria, visualized by mitochondrial marker HSP60 ( Figure S4 [href=this file] B).
Quantification of cellular ATP levels showed no differences between -variant affected individuals and controls ( Figure S5 [href=this file] ).
DTT treatment partially shifted the redox state to a more reduced TMX2 ( Figure 7 [href=#fig7] A, lane 3), and TMX2 was completely reduced in the presence of β-mercaptoethanol ( Figures 5 [href=#fig5] B and S6 [href=this file] ), indicating that at least part of the TMX2 redox state is thiol-mediated.
The dimer was still present when SDS-PAGE was performed in reducing conditions with β-mercaptoethanol and without NEM, although the ratio of dimer/monomer was almost inverted, and the monomer represented the major band ( Figure S6 [href=this file] ). Homodimerization was confirmed through linear correlation between the observed molecular weight on blot (average 57.8 kDa, n = 18) and the calculated expected molecular weight with the method of Lambin for a gradient SDS-PAGE gel (4%–15%) ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ). 47 [href=#bib47]
On the basis of the linear correlation between observed and expected mass, these bands seem to represent homotrimers and tetramers of TMX2 ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ). DTT treatment prevented polymerization of the variants almost completely, confirming that polymerization is (at least partially) mediated by disulfide bridge formation ( Figure 7 [href=#fig7] E, third graph, and Figure S6 [href=this file] ). Notably, mutagenized Myc-tagged TMX2 was still able to bind both CNX and SERCA2 ( Figure S8 [href=this file] ).
These results reflect a physiological sensitivity of TMX2 to H O , possibly mimicking an adaptive response to oxidative eustress, regulating physiological steps in development. 52 [href=#bib52] 54 [href=#bib54] The wild-type TMX2 dimer was still slightly present under β-mercaptoethanol reducing conditions ( Figure S6 [href=this file] ), indicating that it is partially formed through inter-disulfide bonds.",pdf,"TMX2 Is a Crucial Regulator of Cellular Redox State, and Its Dysfunction Causes Severe Brain Developmental Abnormalities - PMC",HTML,"(934KB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/6904804/bin/mmc1.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

The relative abundance of in five individuals, based on estimates from Illumina metagenomic reads that mapped to the 16S rRNA gene, ranged from 5.1 – 10.7% ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). We also examined four individuals co-occurring with in Chapopote using sequencing (15 - 49 million Illumina reads), FISH and PCR (see Supplementary Methods [this file] ). 
were found in all three sponge individuals collected at Chapopote and Mictlan ( Fig. 2c and d [rid=F2] , Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). Their abundances ranged between 4.1% and 8.0% based on the number of reads that mapped to the 16S rRNA gene of the sponge ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). The two encrusting sponges collected from Chapopote and Mictlan belonged to the same species based on 100% identical cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene sequences, while the branching sponge individual belonged to a different species based on COI comparisons (10% nucleotide difference to COI of the encrusting sponge) and phylogenetic analyses ( Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). Both the encrusting and the branching sponge belong to the order Poecilosclerida based on their COI phylogeny ( Suppplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
The genomes had estimated sizes of 2.1-2.2 Mb, GC contents of 42% and were 93-97% complete ( Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). The genomes from the four individuals were highly similar based on their average nucleotide identity (ANI) (≥ 99.95%, Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ) and phylogenomic analyses based on eleven single copy genes ( Supplementary Figure 2 [this file] ). 
Draft genomes from the two sponge species had estimated sizes of 1.6-2.3 Mb, GC contents of 43-44%, and were 90-95% complete ( Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). Their genomes differed considerably from the genome of the branching sponge (ANI = 79.8%) and the mussels (ANI values below 80%, Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
Correspondingly, the genomes of cultivated contain multiple clusters of genes involved in the degradation of PAHs ( Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). Remarkably, none of the symbiotic genomes examined in this study, neither from the mussels nor the two sponge species, contained genes or transcripts attributable to PAH degradation ( Supplementary Note 1-2, Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). These genomic and transcriptomic results were supported by incubation experiments on board with -bearing gill tissues: Despite numerous attempts, we never observed oxidation of C-labelled naphthalene to CO by gill tissues, while control experiments with ATCC 51542 always showed naphthalene oxidation (see Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Methods [this file] ). 
Transcriptomic analyses of the symbiotic from four individuals and the two encrusting sponge individuals revealed that their pHMO genes were the most highly expressed genes compared to all other genes involved in carbon metabolism ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] , Supplementary Tables 6, 7 [this file] ) (transcriptomic sequencing of the branching sponge was not possible, as insufficient RNA was recovered). Proteomics revealed that the subunit A of Group Z pHMO was among the most highly expressed proteins in three individuals ( Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ). 
Indeed, we found genes encoding PQQ-ADHs in the symbiotic of all three host species, and these were also highly expressed in their transcriptomes ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] , Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 [this file] ). The membrane-bound PQQ-ADH was also found in the proteome of one individual ( Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ). The symbiotic PQQ-ADH sequences were highly similar (91%) to PQQ-ADHs assumed to oxidize ethanol and higher alcohols, rather than methanol 36 [rid=R36] ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
AORs were highly expressed in the transcriptomes of symbionts of all three host species, and also present in the proteomes of from two individuals ( Supplementary Table 8, 9 [this file] ). 
These pathways are discussed in detail in the Supplementary Notes 7 - 8 [this file] . 
AORs, the third group of enzymes, are present in the genomes of cultivated but their protein sequences are only 70% similar to those of the symbiotic ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
We found genes encoding the first three enzymes central to the oxidation of short-chain alkanes, pHMO, PQQ-ADH and AOR, in genomes and transcriptomes from the DWH hydrocarbon plume that were highly similar to those of the symbiotic from Campeche Knoll hosts ( Fig. 5 [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 4 and 5 [this file] ). 
As with the pHMOs, the PQQ-ADH sequences of the symbionts were most closely related to PQQ-ADH sequences from DWH bacteria, and formed a highly supported clade with SAG AC281-P21, as well as transcripts from the hydrocarbon plume, with the latter constituting 38% of the total PQQ-ADH transcripts in the plume 36 [rid=R36] ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Symbiotic, free-living and cultivated contain AORs ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
Following homogenization, DNA was extracted from six individuals ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ), according to the standard protocol 50 [rid=R50] , with the following adaptations: 25 μl homogenate aliquots were treated with 40 μl proteinase k and with 20 μl of 20 mg μl RNase for 5 min at 37 °C. RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following manufacturer’s instructions for both gill and sponge samples ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Genomic DNA was sequenced as follows: 12.5 million 250 bp paired-end reads were generated, while further sequencing was done as 150 bp paired-end reads ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). cDNA libraries were sequenced as 100 bp paired-end reads. 
The symbiont genomes were binned based on genome coverage, GC content and taxonomic affiliation using gbtools 52 [rid=R52] , and the differential coverage approach 53 [rid=R53] when applicable ( Supplementary Figure 3 [this file] ). Following manual removal of contigs shorter than 800 bp and contamination screening, quality metrics were calculated with Quast 56 [rid=R56] and CheckM 57 [rid=R57] ( Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
We also mapped our metagenomic reads with BBMap using a minimum identity of 0.6 to the genome (GenBank accession number: NZ_ARVU01000001 (NZ_ARVU01000001) ), to verify the results of the BLAST analyses ( Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). 
The identified proteins are summarized in Supplementary Table 8 [this file] . 
The NSAF% gives the relative abundance of a protein in a sample in % as compared to all other proteins ( Supplementary Table 9 [this file] ). 
Genomes with curated metadata are available through the Integrated Microbial Genome (IMG) database 78 [rid=R78] (analysis project GOLD IDs are summarized in Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ).

At an FDR threshold of 10%, we identified 582 distinct histone mark and Pol II QTLs ( table S2 [href=this file] ).

In total, 12,606 and 12,684 different transcripts were detected across all developmental stages under CO and HS, respectively (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2A and B). Under CO 4538 (36.0%) and under HS 4332 (34.2%) are common to all stages. (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2A and B). The total number of detected protein groups across all stages was 957 in CO and 1062 in HS samples, whereby the fraction of common protein groups between the stages was much lower (~ 20%) than the fraction of common transcripts (~ 35%) (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2C and D). 
Interestingly, inclusion of PC2 revealed no better separation of the developmental stages for the analysis of both, transcriptome and proteome levels (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S3). 
Next, we calculated an overlap matrix, which indicated the number of shared genes between transcript and protein cluster pairs (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S4). 
To compare transcriptome and proteome alterations in response to HS, we generated an overlap matrix for each developmental stage (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5). 
Next, we analyzed the genes with a protein assigned to clusters with strong down- and upregulation (left- and rightmost clusters in Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] , Pr1 and Pr7 clusters in Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5). 
We could show that the transcriptome of developing tomato pollen comprises about 12,600 transcripts across the three analyzed stages (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2A). The proteome size we identified for tomato pollen was 1000 protein groups along the course of development (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2A). 
The number of proteins changed in their abundance is drastically higher for tetrads (~ 30%) and post-meiotic pollen (40%) than for mature pollen (9%, Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] , Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5). 
Further, to determine if a gene was actually detected at the transcriptome level, we determined a threshold based on the established method of Loraine et al. [ 35 [rid=CR35] ] by analyzing the TPM values of genes encoding for LHC proteins (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S1), which are not supposed to be detected due to the absence of chloroplasts in pollen. 
To analyze the behavior of genes at both transcript and protein level along the course of development, we first took the transcript and protein clusters obtained from the first clustering approach (developmental stages under CO) and created an overlap matrix, which indicated the overlap of genes between transcript and protein clusters (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S4).

We found the root growth of wild-type Col-0 was significantly inhibited in the presence of 30 nM CPT compared to the control treated with DMSO, a solvent used to dissolve CPT (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b [this file] ). However, the root growth of , another protein kinase required for DNA damage repair , was much more resistant than (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b [this file] ), suggesting a specific defect of TOP1i in the mutant. Additionally, by staining the root of Col-0 with propidium iodide (PI), a counterstain marking dead cells, we found that CPT treatment could induce the death of root stem cells and reduce the length of meristem zones (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). These growth defects were intensified in mutant, as the root tips of showed severe damage and disorganized morphology, while cell death in was comparable to that in Col-0 (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1a–c [this file] ). 
The results of principal components analysis showed that these samples were clustered in replicates and the -CPT sample presented distinctive R-loop patterns compared to others, consistent with the results of the slot-blot assay and the severe root developmental phenotype of CPT-treated (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). Further analysis of R-loops on all annotated elements observed that showed a higher level of R-loops near TSS than Col-0 (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c [this file] ). Interestingly, TOP1i promoted accumulations of R-loops located on TSS in Col-0, while elevating the R-loops on gene body in (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c [this file] ). Moreover, a large number of R-loops were remarkably increased on genes in after CPT treatment, but more genes showed decreased R-loops in Col-0 after CPT treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). There are little overlapped genes that are commonly regulated in and Col-0 after CPT treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2f [this file] ), indicating R-loop dynamics triggered by CPT vary in different backgrounds. In addition, our analysis showed that the topoR-loops do not correlate with mRNA levels after CPT treatment (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ), suggesting that they do not result from gene expression differences. 
The immunostaining results confirmed that CPT increased γH2AX signals in Col-0 and root tips (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] ), which is consistent with its phosphorylation activity of H2AX. 
The recombinant protein AtRNH1A has RNA:DNA cleavage activities in vitro, and a mutation D160N in the RNase H domain could disturb its catalytic activity (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
R-loop levels indicated by S9.6 in mutants related to Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] . DNA damage levels indicated by γH2AX in mutants related to Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] . 
We then performed further analysis of R-loop and DNA damage levels with S9.6 and γH2AX immunostaining (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
We re-sequenced the mutant population and located the mutation in chromosome 1 (Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ) , and found there were 5 genes with mutations in the regions (Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ). After allelic crossing with mutants of candidate genes with , we verified that (G522N) and (G469R) could rescue CPT-induced defects in (Supplementary Fig. 6b–f [this file] ). Both and are weak alleles of , and their mutation sites are closed to (L473F) (Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). These three mutants have mutations at highly conserved positions among model species (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). Mutant (G522N) is mutated inside the DNA polymerase domain of POL2A (closed to the left border), while (G469R) and (L473F) carry mutations in the junction domain between exonuclease and DNA polymerase domains, within a very conserved region (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). The root lengths of / and / are significantly longer than that of in the presence of CPT (Supplementary Fig. 6c–f [this file] ). Interestingly, and / were blocked with an increasing concentration of CPT (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b [this file] ), whereas both — the single mutant separated from — and showed significant resistance to CPT compared with Col-0 (Supplementary Fig. 7a, b [this file] ). In addition, the root length of was longer than that of and had fewer dead cells under high a concentration of CPT (Supplementary Fig. 7a–c [this file] ), and showed a more structured root morphology compared with / (Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] ). These results suggest the conserved junction domain of POL2A should have an essential role in modulating topological stress during replication, and residue mutations in the junction and DNA polymerase domain of POL2A have conserved effects of varying degrees on the release of topological stress and then the topoR-loops, which is in line with the location of the mutations in the functional domain of the POL2A protein (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). 
Further analysis observed that R-loop levels at protein-coding genes decreased significantly in compared with Col-0 and , and CPT treatment had little additive effect on increasing R-loop levels (Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). had lower overall R-loop levels than Col-0 and , but higher levels than , and CPT elevated the R-loop levels(Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). The antisense R-loops that enriched in the transcription start sites resembled trends of un-stranded R-loop variations(Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). However, the sense R-loops decreased only near TTS sites in , and the extent of the decrease was magnified in (Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). 
Venn diagram of overlap between up-regulated R-loop genes in after CPT treatment in Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] (left), and up-regulated R-loop genes in compared to in Fig. 4b (right). 
To explore the features of differential R-loops on genes in , we intersected the genes possessing up-regulated R-loops in with the genes having CPT-induced R-loops in (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). 
However, R-loops remained stable around the origins, with a low level in , regardless of CPT treatment, that was even lower than that in Col-0 (Fig. 4e, g [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. 8b, c [this file] ). 
Accordingly, we treated the plants with a DNA synthesis inhibitor, hydroxyurea (HU), that arrests DNA replication by depleting dNTPs pools , and found that, , , and were tolerant to HU (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b [this file] ). Additionally, a low dosage of HU (0.25 mM) affected the relative relief of TOP1i-induced root growth defects when the mutants were treated with HU and CPT together (Supplementary Fig. 9a–c [this file] ). Global R-loop levels detected by slot-blot assay decreased after HU treatment in all tested mutants (Supplementary Fig. 9d [this file] ). 
After 2 h of DMSO treatment (T2) and an additional 4 h of recovery (T2 + R4) (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ), EdU-positive (EdU + ) cells of were similar to that of Col-0, while and had more EdU+ cells than Col-0, but the increasing speed of EdU+ cells in and is slower than in Col-0 and (Supplementary Fig. 10b [this file] , left). However, at 4 h after CPT removal, and showed many more EdU+ cells (Supplementary Fig. 10b [this file] ), suggesting that DNA replication and cell cycle in is not efficiently inhibited with TOP1i, or that the repairing system is activated to maintain the cell cycle progress in . Meanwhile, the EdU+ cells in were more than that in after CPT removal (Supplementary Fig. 10b [this file] , CPT T2 + R4), indicating recovers DNA replication process from topology stress faster than , and ATM is involved in this progress of in responding to topology stress. 
Accumulated R-loops at TTS regions promote TRCs , up-regulated sense R-loops increased at TTS of coding genes and the locations of the genes were enriched with the DNA origins (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). Together with the findings that R-loops on DNA origins decreased in and stayed stable after CPT treatment (Fig. 4e [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 8b, c [this file] ), and the fact that genome replication initiates from multiple origins, these results suggest that DSBs could result mainly from the TRCs induced by topoR-loops and the replication stress which could be weakened by POL2A mutation, thus generating less DNA damage. 
Through RNase HII digestion, we detected a high level of rNTPs in the genome after CPT treatment (Fig. 7a, b [rid=Fig7] ), while showed a similar rNTPs incorporation pattern (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] ). We found the root growth of and / was inhibited by TOP1i compared to the individual single mutants (Fig. 7c, d [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 11c, d [this file] ). 
We expressed and purified the catalytic core of WT (POL2A ) and mutant (POL2A ) POL2A (1-1123aa) proteins (Supplementary Fig. 12a, b [this file] ), including polymerase and exonuclease domains which are sufficient for DNA synthesis . The results showed that POL2A synthesized slightly less DNA than POL2A under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. 12c [this file] ), indicating L473F mutation impaired DNA polymerase activity, in line with the double-labeling results (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] ). Besides, we performed rNTPs insertion experiments in vitro using POL2A and POL2A , and the rGTP incorporation levels are comparable between WT and mutant POL2A (Supplementary Fig. 12d [this file] ). Combining the in vivo results (Fig. 7a, b [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] ) which showed high levels of rNTPs were detected only in after CPT treatment, we conclude that TOP1, ATM and POL2A could cooperatively participate in DNA replication progression and replication fidelity in different conditions. 
The mutant was sensitive to MMS as previously reported ; however, did not show MMS sensitivity (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] ). Root lengths of both and were restrained by MMS, and were obviously shorter than those of and (Supplementary Fig. 13a, b [this file] ). The number of dead cells stained with PI was consistent with the inhibited root length (Supplementary Fig. 13b, c [this file] ). Mutations of activated the response to DNA damage and replication fork blockage induced by MMS, and this effect varied with different mutation sites (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ), especially the mutation located in the Type-B polymerase domain that is responsible for DNA synthesis, while the and mutations are in the conserved junction domain (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). 
However, and presented insensitivity to CPT, and the roots of both and were slightly inhibited by CPT, which is different from the single mutant (Fig. 8e, f [rid=Fig8] , Supplementary Fig. 13d [this file] ). 
Notably, the severely aberrant root growth of mutant treated with CPT resulted from increased topoR-loop accumulation and DNA breaks (Figs. 1 [rid=Fig1] , 2 [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
POL2A is relatively conserved in eukaryotes (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ), and it is known that its DNA polymerase domain and exonuclease domain are crucial for DNA replication and nucleotide excision repair (NER) . Here we identified is the suppressor under topological stress (TOP1i), rescuing the short and abnormal root growth of under CPT treatment (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). We showed that is resistant to CPT (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ), while showed higher γH2AX levels than Col-0 (Fig. 3f–h [rid=Fig3] ), suggesting could activate ATR-dependent signaling and WEE1-dependent cell cycle regulation. Only treated with TOP1i accumulated a very high level of ribonucleotides (Fig. 7a, b [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] ), -caused ribonucleotides incorporation is TOP1-dependent, and further lead to DNA breaks, and this relies on ATM for repair (Fig. 9 [rid=Fig9] ). In addition, combining with genetic results that abolished the resistance of to TOP1i (Fig. 7c, d [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] and 11c, d [this file] ), and R-loops near DNA origins decreased in (Fig. 4f [rid=Fig4] ), we speculate that AtRNH2A could remove R-loops near DNA replication regions, especially on nascent DNA containing high ribonucleotides (Fig. 9 [rid=Fig9] ). 
The mutations that we used are located in the conserved and uncharacterized junction domain (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ).

The summary for small RNA library in parental and spheroids was shown in Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S1. The top ten most abundant miRNAs with expression values observed in parental and spheroids were listed in Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S2. Using 2-fold expression difference as a cut-off level, 25 up-regulated and 109 down-regulated miRNAs were identified ( Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S3), indicating that there were marked changes in their miRNAs content between the two cell types. 
The top five up- and down- regulated miRNAs which were >2-fold differentially expressed and contained broad range of predicted target genes are as listed in Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S4 and S5. 
The detailed information of the GO analysis is tabulated in Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S6 and S7. 
Based on the inferred KEGG pathways for the miRNAs, one was related to self-renewal (Wnt signaling pathway), four related to drug resistance (pathways in cancer, MAPK signaling pathway, and axon guidance), and one related to structure (Actin cytoskeleton) (Figure 9 [rid=F9] and Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S8). 
The selected microRNAs and their targeted sequence were listed in Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S9. 
The pathway analysis revealed that these genes were significantly related to the “axon guidance pathway”, “pathways in cancer”, “MAPK signalling pathway”, “Wnt signalling pathway”, “regulation of actin cytoskeleton”, “insulin signalling”, “regulation of actin cytoskeleton”, “mTor signalling pathway” and “ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis” ( Additional File 1 [this file] : Table S8).",xlsx,MiRNA Transcriptome Profiling of Spheroid-Enriched Cells with Cancer Stem Cell Properties in Human Breast MCF-7 Cell Line,XML,,,,,,,

The Bpa substitution at position Leu12 was chosen after testing a number of conserved residues (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). 24% and 19% of the identified Chp1-crosslinking partners were found to be involved in translation and protein quality control, respectively (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM4] ). The α-subunit of NAC, Egd2, was ranked as a top hit and using serum detecting Egd1 and Egd2 we found that NAC directly crosslinked with Chp1-L12Bpa (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). Despite that the models did not recapitulate all 12 strands of the β-barrel-like heterodimer determined by crystallography for the human NAC heterodimerization domain they both suggested that Chp1 binds NAC via direct interaction with the UBA domain of its α-subunit, Egd2 (Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ) . Co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) of GFP-tagged Chp1 from yeast cells and purification of Chp1 from co-expressing NAC (Egd1 and Egd2) validated that Chp1 forms a complex with NAC via direct binding to Egd2 (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1e [this file] ). 
We confirmed by sedimentation experiments and co-IP that Chp1 associates with the ribosome (Fig. 1e, f [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1f [this file] ). The association with the ribosome was reduced when was deleted (Fig. 1f [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1f [this file] ). Polysome profile analysis revealed that nascent chain release upon puromycin treatment abrogated the interaction of Chp1 with translating ribosomes, demonstrating the key role of the nascent polypeptides in Chp1 recruitment to the 80 S ribosomes (Supplementary Fig. 1g [this file] ). 
The most enriched transcripts identified by Chp1-SeRP belonged to the near-identical and ( ), encoding eEF1A, suggesting that eEF1A is the sole nascent-chain substrate of Chp1 (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). 
In addition, size-exclusion chromatography analysis of the copurified fraction from the recombinant system confirmed the presence of a stable Chp1-eEF1A domain I complex (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ). Having established the Chp1-eEF1A domain I complex, we used in vitro site-specific UV crosslinking between purified Chp1 with single Bpa substitutions in the N-terminal α-helix (Q18, V21 or E25) and domain I of eEF1A to test the involvement of this helix in the interaction (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ). All three positions harboring the zero-spacer crosslinker Bpa formed specific crosslinks with eEF1A domain I, demonstrating direct interaction with the domain (Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] ). Upon mutational analysis we found using the heterologous coexpression system that alanine substitutions of Chp1 residues predicted to interact with eEF1A, or complete removal of residues 2 to 28 significantly decreased the interaction (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). 
Consistent with previous reports we found that full-length eEF1A quantitatively aggregated when expressed in (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). In contrast, when Chp1 was coexpressed, eEF1A solubility was significantly increased and this soluble fraction could be copurified with Chp1 (Supplementary Fig. 3a–e [this file] ). The copurified complex contained many contaminating proteins not observed in the control purifications suggesting that eEF1A was misfolded and unspecifically interacted with these species (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Indeed, only minimal interaction between Chp1 and eEF1A could be observed with the highest interaction being detected in the presence of EDTA (10% of purified Chp1 was bound to eEF1A), a treatment that impedes nucleotide binding and thus destabilizes the GTPase domain (Supplementary Fig. 3f [this file] ). In a parallel approach, in vitro site-specific UV crosslinking between Chp1 with Bpa substitution at position E25 and eEF1A demonstrated impaired interaction between the proteins in the presence of nucleotide or high glycerol concentration (Supplementary Fig. 3g [this file] ). 
The analysis mapped eEF1A-related functions including tRNA biogenesis, aminoacylation and the structural itself (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). Looking exclusively at the negative genetic interactions of , we substantiated the finding of an involvement in translation (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). This was further supported by finding that 7 of the negative interactors involved in translation and protein quality control ( , J-domain protein for Hsp70; , eEF1A; , eEF1Bγ; , ubiquitin E3 ligase; , eIF5A; , ribosomal 40 S subunit protein S0A; , ATPase 19 S proteosome) were also identified as physical interactors in our MS analysis (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). Direct testing by construction of a Δ Δ mutant, revealed a more severe growth impairment at 30 °C and 37 °C compared to Δ cells (Fig. 3a, b [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 5a, b [this file] ). 
We quantified eEF1A levels in the mutants using western blot analysis (Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). Inactivation of NAC ( ) alone or in combination with Chp1 caused no further reduction of the total eEF1A levels (Supplementary Fig. 5d [this file] ). Since total and mRNA levels were not reduced in the Δ cells (Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] ), we investigated whether Chp1 is required for the efficient biogenesis of eEF1A. To investigate the biogenesis defect, we isolated protein aggregates and found that while the amount of ubiquitylated protein aggregates were increased in Δ cells, eEF1A did not accumulate in the aggregates (Supplementary Fig. 5f [this file] ). Additionally, ribosome profiling (RP) analysis showed the same ribosome density along the / transcripts for WT and Δ cells ruling out a defect in the translation of these transcripts in the absence of Chp1 (Supplementary Fig. 5g [this file] ). 
Metagene profiles of Δ cells showed a typical enrichment of ribosomes at the start of the coding sequences of all translated genes, followed by an overall uniform ribosome distribution, indicating that the reduced levels of eEF1A did not cause major global changes in the translation process (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] , = 0.99, < 2.2e ). In contrast to Zpr1 depletion, the integrated stressed response was only weakly induced as evidenced by a mere 1.5-fold increased translation of (Supplementary Fig. 6c [this file] ). 
In line, + induced a pronounced growth defect in Δ cells at the stressful temperature of 39 °C (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). While Δ cells displayed a growth defect at 39 °C, Δ cells grew indistinguishable from WT cells, and the Δ Δ double mutant phenocopied Δ cells (Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] ). In the same line, unlike Δ cells Δ cells did not activate Hsf1 or promote cytosolic protein aggregation (Supplementary Fig. 7c–e [this file] ). 
Sequence variants in have been found in patients with neurodevelopmental epilepsy and intellectual disability (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). All mutants but one (R421C) exhibited significantly reduced protein levels in WT cells with even further reduced levels in Δ cells (Supplementary Fig. 8b [this file] ). The mutants appeared to represent recessive destabilized variants, since they did not cause prominent growth impairment (Supplementary Fig. 8c, d [this file] ). When G70S and F98C eEF1A variants were expressed from the induced promoter, the rate of their production was significantly reduced in Δ cells, indicating that Chp1 plays a major role in de novo synthesis of also the eEF1A variants (Fig. 5c, d [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 8e [this file] ). Upon translation arrest, the F98C variant was found to be significantly less stable than WT or the G70S variant, and the turnover of the F98C variant was significantly accelerated in Δ cells (Fig. 5e, f [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 8f [this file] ).

The corresponding expression data are shown in Appendix Fig S5 [this file] . 
This interpretation was confirmed by assays monitoring cell cycle progression and apoptosis: While apoptosis occurred during the first two hours of the experiment, later time points showed a continued division of the majority cells (Fig 1 [rid=msb156423-fig-0001] A, middle/lower panel; Appendix Fig S3 [this file] ). 
Genome‐wide transcriptomics measurements confirmed this view and manifested roughly three phases of the response where concerted changes happened: (<2 h), (2–8 h), and (> 8 h) (Fig 1 [rid=msb156423-fig-0001] B, Appendix Fig S5 [this file] ). 
A variety of tests confirmed the quality of the proteomic data, for example, Western blots of selected proteins and analysis of housekeeping genes, and its reproducibility across the two biological replicates (Appendix Figs S11 [this file]S12 [this file] and S13 [this file] ). We also constructed an extended dataset with 2,131 proteins which showed similar results ( Appendix Fig S19 [this file] ). 
Protein concentrations spanned about five orders of magnitude ( Appendix Table S1 [this file] ), which is similar to what other large‐scale studies observe (Schwanhausser , 2011 [rid=msb156423-bib-0048] ). Their reproducibility was high ( > 0.94 for seven of the eight time points, Appendix Fig S10 [this file] ); the correlation with the corresponding mRNA concentrations was consistent across samples ( Appendix Fig S13 [this file] ). Heatmaps of the integrated and clustered mRNA and protein expression values show that overall expression changes were similar between the two biological replicates (Fig 2 [rid=msb156423-fig-0002] , Appendix Figs S5 [this file] , S9 [this file] and S14 [this file] ), but some discrepancies existed. Appendix Fig S13 [this file] displays the frequency distributions of all RCM values and shows a bias toward high values. 
For example, genes involved in the general stress response were significantly up‐regulated during the intermediate and late phase of the experiment both at the mRNA and at the protein level ( Appendix Fig S14 [this file] ). 
This regulatory event is also an example of the sometimes counterbalancing effects of RNA‐ and protein‐level regulation (discussed below and in Appendix Fig S16 [this file] ). 
In contrast, protein concentrations continuously diverged from the beginning until the end of the experiment, with much less change during the late phase (Fig 4 [rid=msb156423-fig-0004] , Appendix Fig S15 [this file] ). The magnitude of change was also more pronounced for proteins than for mRNAs, illustrated by the average (and range) of expression fold changes which were larger than those for mRNAs (Fig 4 [rid=msb156423-fig-0004] , Appendix Table S1 [this file] ). 
An alternative way to identify discordant regulation confirmed this result, that is, via filtering for negative correlation between PECA's mRNA and protein time‐course rate ratios in both replicates ( Dataset EV1 [rid=msb156423-sup-0002] , Appendix Fig S16A and B [this file] ). Three out of the 75 genes passed this additional filtering and are shown in Appendix Fig S16C [this file] . 
The pulse‐like or transient behavior of the RNA‐level regulation was confirmed both for the extended dataset (2,131 genes) and for the entire transcriptome (> 18,000 genes) ( Appendix Figs S19 [this file] and S21 [this file] ), indicating that the high‐confidence dataset delivers representative results. 
It is also present in the extended dataset ( Appendix Fig S19 [this file] ). 
This behavior makes HSC70 one of the three examples for potential buffering discussed above ( Appendix Fig S16 [this file] ). 
The second example group comprises 196 genes with invariable RNA concentrations, but whose protein concentrations increased during the late phase ( Appendix Fig S14 [this file] , Dataset EV1 [rid=msb156423-sup-0002] , cluster 8). 
To generate hypotheses on possible mechanisms for the up‐regulation of these proteins, we collected > 160 sequence features, including length, signal sequences, nucleotide composition, amino acid composition, translation regulatory elements, RNA secondary structures, and post‐translation modifications ( Appendix Table S2 [this file] ). 
The aminoacyl‐tRNA synthetases are shown in Fig 6 [rid=msb156423-fig-0006] C and are examined in more detail in Appendix Figs S17 [this file] and S18 [this file] . 
Based on these findings, we hypothesized that the discrepancy between mRNA and protein expression patterns for some genes might be explained by the differential expression of splice variants, and we examined the proteomics data manually for such examples ( Appendix Figs S17 [this file] and S18 [this file] ). 
While the major results from this study have been confirmed by analysis of the total transcriptome ( Appendix Fig S21 [this file] ) and an extended mRNA/protein dataset ( Appendix Fig S19 [this file] ), our discussions are still restricted to a comparatively small subset of the proteome. 
In both the ER stress response described here and the published data on the LPS response, regulation at both RNA and protein level contributes to the change in the system, and protein expression changes drive the synthesis and turnover of highly abundant molecules ( Appendix Figs S22 [this file] and S23 [this file] , Appendix Tables S1 [this file] , S3 [this file] and S4 [this file] ). 
We aimed to estimate the generality of these findings by re‐analyzing the published dataset on the LPS response with PECA ( Appendix Figs S22 [this file] and S23 [this file] , Appendix Tables S3 [this file] and S4 [this file] ) (Jovanovic , 2015 [rid=msb156423-bib-0020] ). 
To account for different cellular ages at harvest, the experiment was conducted so that the experiment started with the 30‐h treatment period, and the cells were then collected at the same time ( Appendix Fig S1 [this file] ). 
To confirm the accuracy of the transcriptomics experiments, selected time points were compared to data collected from the same samples, but using RNA‐seq ( Appendix Fig S8 [this file] ). 
The final mRNA expression data for the two replicates are shown in Appendix Fig S5 [this file] . As described in the Results [rid=msb156423-sec-0002] and Appendix [this file] , several tests, for example, comparison to RNA‐sequencing data, validated the accuracy of the transcriptome data ( Appendix Figs S6 [this file] and S7 [this file] ). 
MaxQuant was used to combine the cytosolic and pellet samples as different fractions in the same experiment, after testing different options ( Appendix Fig S8 [this file] ). 
Appendix Fig S19 [this file] describes the details of this analysis and the results, which were consistent with those from the high‐confidence dataset. Several tests, for example, Western blotting, validated the quality of the proteomics data as described in the Results [rid=msb156423-sec-0002] and Appendix [this file] ( Appendix Figs S11 [this file] and S12 [this file] ). 
For further cluster analysis, 164 sequence features from various databases and tools were assembled ( Appendix Table S2 [this file] ).",pdf,Differential dynamics of the mammalian,XML,,,,,,,

From seven independent experiments, we obtained a total number of 717 spectra that were assigned to KEA3 peptides ( Supplementary Data Set S1 [this file] ). 
We selected plants expressing and and Col-0 plants expressing ( Figure 2, B [rid=kiab135-F2] and Supplemental Figure S2, A [this file] ). In line with the phenotype of and ( Armbruster et al., 2016 [rid=kiab135-B4] ), these plants were visually indistinguishable from WT (Col-0, Supplemental Figure S2, B [this file] ). Still, KEA3.3 levels in L2 were much lower than in the line #1 that was previously shown to have nine-fold higher KEA3 content than WT ( Supplemental Figure S2, A [this file] ; Armbruster et al., 2016 [rid=kiab135-B4] ). The newly generated plants ( Figure 2, B [rid=kiab135-F2] and Supplemental Figure S2, B [this file] ) were measured for NPQ behavior during an alternating light regime of dark to low light to high light, back to low light, and finally dark, together with the WT Col-0 and line #1 ( Armbruster et al., 2016 [rid=kiab135-B4] ). 
Indeed, when we expressed from the promoter in Col-0, the resulting plants exhibited reduced NPQ in high light ( Supplemental Figure S3, A–D [this file] ). 
Protein levels of these lines were determined by gradient Western blots ( Supplemental Figure S4, A [this file] ). This analysis revealed that / L1 had slightly less than 50% of WT KEA3 levels, while both / L2 and / had approximately twice the amount of WT KEA3 ( Supplemental Figure S4, A [this file] ). Consequently, the lines were renamed ( / L1), ( / L2), and ( / ) for a shortened and more descriptive representation. 77K Chl fluorescence emission spectra of these lines together with WT and showed no genotype-specific differences in the relative antenna cross sections, and excitation energy distribution between both photosystems ( Supplemental Figure S4, B [this file] ). Likewise, total chlorophyll (Chl) content per leaf area ( Supplemental Figure S4, C [this file] ), the Chl a/b ratio ( Supplemental Figure S4, D [this file] ), and the maximum amplitude of difference transmittance signals of P , the Chl dimer in the PSI reaction center ( Supplemental Figure S4, E [this file] ), and plastocyanin ( Supplemental Figure S4, F [this file] ), both normalized to the Chl content, did not reveal any significant differences. Finally, also the maximum quantum efficiency of PSII in the dark-adapted state ( / ; Supplemental Figure S4, G [this file] ) was indistinguishable between WT and all mutant lines. 
In line with the results obtained during the shifts from low to high light ( Figure 2, C [rid=kiab135-F2] and Supplemental Figure S3, B [this file] ), NPQ was initially significantly lower in dark-acclimated KEA3.3 containing plants after shift to high light by about 10% when compared with the other lines ( Figure 3, B [rid=kiab135-F3] ). Moreover, also differing from the results of the previous shorter fluctuations, where all expressing plants continued to have lower NPQ than the expressing lines up to 5 min after shift from low to high light ( Figure 2, C [rid=kiab135-F2] and Supplemental Figure S3, B [this file] ), NPQ levels became very similar between all lines at 5 min after transition from dark to high light ( Figure 3, B [rid=kiab135-F3] ). The quantum efficiency of PSII was increased in after 2–3 min in high light and reduced in and after the transition from high to low light ( Supplemental Figure S5, A [this file] ). 
ECS recovery in the dark was slowest in ( of recovery at ∼3.5 s, with WT, 2xKEA3.2 and 0.5xKEA3.3 at ∼2.5 s) and fastest in ( at ∼1.4 s; Supplemental Figure S5, B [this file] ). The membrane conductivity for protons ( ) was unchanged between genotypes in high light ( Figure 3, F [rid=kiab135-F3] ), as were the acceptor availability of PSII expressed as qL, levels of oxidized cytochrome- (Cyt ), and PSI donor and acceptor side limitations ( Figure 3, G–I [rid=kiab135-F3] and Supplemental Figure S5, C [this file] ). 
All plants expressing KEA3-GFP fusions had a faster recovery of the ECS signal than WT and ( Supplemental Figure S5, D [this file] ). The donor side limitation of PSI was significantly lower in when compared with ( Figure 3, O [rid=kiab135-F3] ), while PSI acceptor side limitation remained unchanged between genotypes ( Supplemental Figure S5, E [this file] ). 
The fastest recovery was observed for and the slowest for ( Supplemental Figure S5, B and D [this file] ), which suggests that deregulation and levels of KEA3 have an additive effect on the ECS recovery in the dark after low light. 
There was no significant difference in the electron transport rate through PSII between genotypes ( Supplemental Figure S5, F [this file] ). showed increased NPQ and qL in low and medium light when compared with WT ( Supplemental Figure S5, G and H [this file] ). showed strong differences to WT mostly during high light with decreased NPQ and PSI donor site limitation and enhanced PSI acceptor side limitation at very high, non-physiological light intensities ( Supplemental Figure S5, G–I [this file] ). 
As expected from the spectroscopic analyses ( Supplemental Figure S4, B–G [this file] ), no significant differences in thylakoid complex composition or stoichiometry were apparent between the different lines ( Figure 5, A [rid=kiab135-F5] ). 
We then searched for potential protein interaction partners of KEA3 by analyzing the co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) results obtained from the and lines ( Supplemental Figure S1 and Supplemental File S1 [this file] ). The strongest candidates for interactions were selected based on their presence in at least 4 (of 7) Co-IP eluates of and or 2 (of 4) of and absence in the Col-0 controls ( Supplementary File S1 [this file] ). The Co-IP results showed that PsbS and FtsH subunits bind to the GFP trap, because they are found in the pellet of Col-0, which does not express a KEA3-GFP fusion, and thus can likely be considered contaminations ( Supplemental Figure S6, A [this file] ). Additionally, gel slices that contained KEA3 high molecular weight complexes were excised from the BN-PAGE ( Figure 5, A and B [rid=kiab135-F5] and Supplemental Figure S6, B [this file] ) and analyzed for their protein composition by MS. The MS analysis of BN-gel slices mainly reproduced the protein blot results, with KEA3 being differentially accumulated depending on size and isoform and lacking from slices of the mutant ( Supplemental Figure S6, B–D [this file] ). None of the other potential interaction candidates showed a similar pattern as KEA3 ( Supplemental Figure S6, E [this file] ). However, except for Alb3 and TLP18.3, all other proteins were present at much higher levels (more than four-fold) than KEA3 in the analyzed gel slices ( Supplemental Figure S6, E [this file] ). 
Thus, we generated recombinant KEA3 C-terminus ( Figure 5, C [rid=kiab135-F5] and Supplemental Figure S7 [this file] ), removed residual free Ni ions by adding EDTA to avoid interaction of the His -tags and performed size exclusion chromatography (SEC, Figure 5, D [rid=kiab135-F5] ). The identity of the band as the KEA3 C-terminus was confirmed by protein blot analysis using the specific KEA3 antibody ( Figure 5, E [rid=kiab135-F5] ) and MS analysis of the purified protein ( Supplementary File S1 [this file] ). The MS analysis revealed that the KEA3-terminus was the main component and contaminating proteins were 100-fold less abundant in the sample ( Supplementary File S1 [this file] ). 
The hypothesis that is strongly activated after a transition to low light is based on the finding (3) that mutants have a slow NPQ relaxation ( Supplemental Figure S3, B [this file] ), while NPQ decay is strongly accelerated in plants over-accumulating KEA3.2 as in in this work ( Figure 2, C [rid=kiab135-F2] ), and in overexpressors ( Armbruster et al., 2016 [rid=kiab135-B4] ). plants show no significant alterations of NPQ relaxation when compared with WT or ( Figure 2, D [rid=kiab135-F2] ). Given that this assumption is correct, our data suggest that KEA3.2 is also active directly after transition to dark ( Supplemental Figure S5, B–D [this file] ). 
Further evidence for this notion can be found in the light response curves, which reveal lower PSI donor side and increased acceptor side limitation at high light in when compared with the other lines ( Supplemental Figure S5, H–I [this file] ). 
Plants expressing either or from the promoter were generated as follows: and coding sequences were amplified from the constructs ( Armbruster et al., 2016 [rid=kiab135-B4] ) by using the primer sequences described in Supplemental Table S1 [this file] , and then assembled downstream of the (1,854 bp) and upstream of the (104 bp) into the 100 vector ( Earley et al., 2006 [rid=kiab135-B19] ) cut with the two restriction enzymes I and I by using Gibson assembly ( Gibson et al., 2009 [rid=kiab135-B26] ).

The FAM-labelled oligonucleotides (detailed in Supplementary Table S1 [this file] ) were heated at 95°C for 5 min in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.5 buffer with 150 mM KCl and annealing to 25°C at a rate of −1°C/min. 
The structural model of G4PID, as depicted in Figure 1A [rid=F1] and Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] , showcased its composition: RHAU23 positioned at the N-terminal, miniTurbo at the C-terminal, and an intermediary flexible linker bridging the two components. The nucleotide sequences used in EMSA were detailed in Supplementary Table S1 [this file] . Circular dichroism spectroscopy was utilized to confirm the G4 conformation of each sequence (Figure 1B [rid=F1] and Supplementary Figure S2 [this file] ). We also confirmed that G4PID binds to G4s exhibiting different conformations and showed negligible binding affinity to single-stand oligos and double-strands hairpins (Figure 1B [rid=F1] , C [rid=F1] and Supplementary Figure S2 [this file] ). 
As shown in Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] , G4PID predominantly localized within the nucleus, with a secondary presence in the cytoplasm, which is different from the homogeneous distribution of miniTurbo. As shown in Figure 2A [rid=F2] , a [rid=F2] remarkable 57.60% of G4PID-binding sites were found to contain PQS, while only 16.85% of random sequences observed contain PQS ( Supplementary Figure S4 [this file] ). We have compared G4PID eCLIP PQS with PQS data from rG4-seq and DMS-seq was analyzed and shown in Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] . 
The pull-down proteins were visualized by streptavidin–HRP blotting ( Supplementary Figure S6 [this file] ). Three independent biological replicates were performed, resulting in a coverage of 578 proteins with an 80% consistency rate, thus affirming the repeatability of our methodology (Figure 3B [rid=F3] , Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ). Ultimately, our approach yielded a total of 149 candidate G4-interacting proteins ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] , Figure 3C [rid=F3] ). 
In aggregate, 31 out of the total 149 proteins (20.8%) had been previously reported in the previous literature ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ). 
To validate the G4 binding affinity of newly identified candidate proteins, we selected several of them and expressed recombinant proteins in Rosetta2 ( Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] ). 
Protein binding affinity with single stranded DNA and double stranded DNA hairpin were conducted as control ( Supplementary Figure S8 [this file] ). 
We further verified that SF3B4 binds specifically to the G4 structure formed by G4-INPPL1 and G4-PPP6R2, and not to their mutant sequences which possess similar nucleotide composition but cannot form G4 structure (Figure 6B [rid=F6] and Supplementary Figure S9 [this file] ).",zip,Identification of G-quadruplex-interacting proteins in living cells using an artificial G4-targeting biotin ligase,XML,,,,,,,

Similar results were obtained when using antibodies against Ser5-phosphorylated RNAPII (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). Although the CS proteins and TFIIH readily assembled with RNAPIIo after UV irradiation, downstream repair proteins such as XPA, ERCC1-XPF, and XRCC1 could not be detected (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1a [this file] ). It should be noted that we could not detect UVSSA either after pull-down of RNAPIIo or in whole cell lysates due to a lack of specific antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). 
See Supplementary Fig. 1a [this file] for each individual Co-IP. See Supplementary Fig. 2a, b [this file] for validation of knockouts by sequencing. 
The knockout of CSB, CSA, and UVSSA was confirmed by western blot analysis and/or DNA sequencing (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] ; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b [this file] ). As an additional control we also included XPC-KO cells, which are deficient in global genome repair (GGR; Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ). 
See Supplementary Figs. 3 [this file] and 4 [this file] for a full overview of all tested mutants. See Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] for additional alignments. 
To identify the CSA-interaction domain in CSB, we fused various truncated fragments of CSB to mCherry-LacR and examined their ability to recruit CSA-GFP to the LacO array (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Figs. 3 [this file] , 4 [this file] ). Conversely, tethering of a LacR-tagged CSB region spanning the C-terminus (C and ∆N) triggered robust recruitment of CSA-GFP (Fig. 2b–d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). However, a region just upstream of the UBD (1306–1399) is sufficient to mediate CSA recruitment to the LacO array (Fig. 2b–d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). Further deletion analysis showed that CSB lacking the region just upstream of the UBD (1353–1399) failed to recruit CSA-GFP, whereas CSB lacking the UBD (1400–1428) or amino acids 1306–1352 were fully proficient in interacting with CSA-GFP (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Moreover, while CSB and CSB were fully proficient in recruiting CSA-GFP to the LacO array, deleting amino acids 1385–1399 abolished the ability of CSB to interact with CSA-GFP (Fig. 2b–d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). These findings identify an evolutionary conserved CSA-interaction motif (CIM) in CSB that is located between amino acids 1385–1399 (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
These findings were confirmed by quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) after pull-down of GFP-tagged versions of either CSB or CSB (Supplementary Fig. 6a–c [this file] , see Supplementary Table 7 [this file] for link to interactive volcano plots). To determine whether the CIM can mediate a functional interaction between CSB and CSA, we mixed recombinant CSB or CSB with ubiquitin, E1, E2, and the E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4 consisting of CSA, DDB1, CUL4A, and RBX1 (Supplementary Fig. 6d [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 6e [this file] for additional Co-IP data. See also Supplementary Fig. 6d [this file] . 
The knockout of CSB and CSA was verified by western blot analysis, DNA sequencing (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] ; Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ), and Illudin S clonogenic survival assays (Fig. 4b [rid=Fig4] ). 
Interestingly, TFIIH also failed to associate with RNAPIIo in CSB-KO cells complemented with GFP-CSB (Supplementary Fig. 6e [this file] ), consistent with our findings that this mutant is not capable of recruiting CSA (Fig. 3c, g [rid=Fig3] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] for additional XR-seq data. 
Additionally, among the most prominent UV-specific interactions were the TFIIH subunits XPB/p89 and XPD/p80 (Fig. 5b [rid=Fig5] ; see Supplementary Table 7 [this file] for link to interactive volcano plots). 
In addition, we included XPA-KO cells (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ) as a positive control since XPA recruitment, at least during GGR, occurs downstream of TFIIH . 
We generated nucleotide-resolution maps of UV-induced CPDs repair in U2OS WT cells (Fig. 5f [rid=Fig5] ; Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ; Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ), which revealed that CPD repair under these conditions is enriched on the transcribed strands within gene bodies consistent with TCR-mediated repair . Importantly, the bias in CPD repair observed in transcribed strands was completely lost in both CSA-KO (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ) and UVSSA-KO cells (Fig. 5f [rid=Fig5] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 7b, c [this file] for additional Co-IP data. 
These interactors were virtually absent after pull-down of GFP-UVSSA (Fig. 6e [rid=Fig6] ; Supplementary Fig. 7b, c [this file] ). Pull-down of GFP-UVSSA resulted in a strong UV-induced interaction with RNAPIIo, CSB, and CSA, while its interaction with TFIIH was completely abolished (Fig. 6e [rid=Fig6] ; Supplementary Fig. 7b, c [this file] ). Interestingly, this approach also identified several proteins that interacted with UVSSA , but not with the UVSSA mutants (Supplementary Fig. 8a–e [this file] ; see Supplementary Table 7 [this file] for link to interactive volcano plots). 
In line with this, genome-wide XR-seq revealed that the stable expression of GFP-UVSSA and GFP-UVSSA in UVSSA-KO cells failed to restore the repair of CPDs in the transcribed strand, which was fully restored by GFP-UVSSA (Fig. 7b [rid=Fig7] ; Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] for additional XR-seq data. 
Interestingly, the CIM region in CSB is evolutionary conserved in species that also contain the gene, including mammals, amphibians and fish (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). However, the CIM is absent in species without CSA, including yeast, nematodes, but also holometabolous insects, which have lost the gene during the course of evolution (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
Cell lines (listed in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ) were cultured at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO in DMEM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with penicillin/streptomycin (Sigma) and 10% Fetal bovine serum (FBS; Bodinco BV). 
To generate stable knockouts, U2OS Flp-In/T-REx cells were co-transfected with pLV-U6g-PPB encoding a guide RNA from the LUMC/Sigma-Aldrich sgRNA library (see Supplementary Table 2 [this file] for plasmids, Supplementary Table 3 [this file] for sgRNA sequences) together with an expression vector encoding Cas9-2A-GFP (pX458; Addgene #48138) using lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). 
Fragments of ~1 kb, containing the sgRNA sequence, were amplified by PCR (sequencing primers are listed in Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ) followed by Sanger sequencing using either the forward or the reverse primer. 
Selected knockout clones of CSB, CSA, and UVSSA (see Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ) were subsequently used to stably express GFP-CSB , GFP-CSB , CSA -GFP, GFP-UVSSA , GFP-UVSSA , and GFP-UVSSA by co-transfection of pCDNA5/FRT/TO-Puro plasmid encoding these CSB, CSA, and UVSSA variants (2 µg), together with pOG44 plasmid encoding the Flp recombinase (0.5 µg). 
CSB , CSA , and UVSSA were amplified by PCR (see Supplementary Table 5 [this file] for primers) and inserted into pcDNA5/FRT/TO-Puro-GFP-N1 or pcDNA5/FRT/TO-Puro-GFP-C1 and in mCherry-LacR-NLS-C1/C3. 
For interactors of the CSB and UVSSA mutant proteins (Supplementary Figs. 6a [this file] –c and 8a–e [this file] ), mass spectrometry analysis was performed as previously described . 
Links to the interactive volcano plots are listed in Supplementary Table 7 [this file] and in the relevant figure legends. 
The membrane was then probed with antibodies (listed in Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ) as indicated. 
CPDs were detected using anti-CPD mouse monoclonal antibody followed by incubation with an anti-mouse HRP conjugated antibody (Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ). 
All open reading frames were cloned into pAceBac1 (pAB1) or pIDC vectors containing the indicated affinity tags (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ).

The Flag-tagged mTrim24 transposon integrated as a single copy, into the q-arm of chromosome 1 without disrupting any known genes or regulatory elements, as determined by whole-genome sequencing and PCR (Supplementary Fig. S1e [this file] and Supplementary Data 3 [this file] ). transcript expression in the whole mammary gland was increased ~2.5–3-fold in mice, as compared to controls (Supplementary Fig. S1c [this file] ). TRIM24 and exogenous Flag-TRIM24 protein levels in the mammary epithelium were confirmed by western blot analysis (Supplementary Fig. S1d [this file] ). Necropsy revealed no other primary tumor sites and two mice with metastases: one to the lung and the other to the liver (Supplementary Data 4 [this file] ). , lacking MMTV-Cre-expression, lacked any palpable tumor formation within 600 days and MMTV-Cre-only mice ( = 27) had occasional hyperplasia and spontaneous mammary tumor development (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] ). tumors overexpressed TRIM24 compared to controls, as determined by IHC (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] ). tumors exhibited overexpression of FLAG and TRIM24 proteins and lacked detectable expression of p53 (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] ), compared to Cre-only control mammary glands. 
Pathologic examination of mammary tumors formed in mice revealed three tumor types, including adenoma (8%), carcinoma (25%), and carcinosarcoma (67%) (Fig. 2a [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Data 4 [this file] ). Assessment of carcinosarcoma tumors by IHC revealed gain of vimentin, loss of E-cadherin, estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), and no over-expression of receptor tyrosine kinase erbB-2 (ERBB2) (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
Expression of TRIM24 was additionally assessed by IHC of a tumor array with 46 MpBC patient biopsies and quantified according to previously published convention (Supplementary Data 5 [this file] ) . High nuclear TRIM24 levels were found in 27% spindle and 45% matrix producing subtyped MpBC patients, similar to the cohort distribution of subtypes (Supplementary Data 5 [this file] ). 
Using a false discovery rate (FDR) of 5%, we found 2006 genes, 529 up-regulated and 1477 down-regulated, had at least 5-fold change (Supplementary Data 6 [this file] ). 
To validate the expression of genes within the top 1% (based on FDR) of DEGs in our RNA-Seq analysis, we used qRT-PCR analysis of RNA isolated from tumors (carcinoma, = 3: tumor number 2735, 3956, and 89; metaplastic carcinosarcoma, = 3: tumor number 567, 64, and 897) and controls (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). As predicted by RNA-seq, qRT-PCR shows that , gelactin-1 ( ), macrophage migration inhibitory factor ( ), cyclin-dependent kinase Inhibitor 2 A ( ), vimentin ( ), and fibronectin 1 ( ) were highly expressed in TRIM24-driven tumors compared to Cre-only mammary glands (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). In comparison, p53 ( , aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 family member A1 ( ), V-set domain-containing T-cell activation inhibitor 1 ( ), synuclein gamma ( ), leukocyte receptor tyrosine kinase ( ), E-cadehrin ( ), and synaptotagmin 9 ( ) were down-regulated in TRIM24-driven tumors compared to Cre-controls (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b [this file] ). 
Interestingly, the EMT scores of TRIM24-driven and non-TRIM24-driven carcinomas were not significantly different (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). 
We compared the gene expression analysis of Weiget et al. by means of the calculated TRIM24 metaplastic score and found that this cohort of human MpBC tumors has a significantly higher TRIM24 metaplastic score than TRIM24-driven carcinomas, as did TRIM24-driven metaplastic carcinosarcomas (Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ), predicting that TRIM24 is activated in human metaplastic tumors. Comparison of our calculated TRIM24 metaplastic score to microarray expression analysis of MMTV-Met-driven and MMTV-Met;Trp53 tumors revealed that the TRIM24 signature is significantly higher in the two MET-driven metaplastic models, but not the non-metaplastic p53/MET model (Supplementary Fig. 3e [this file] ). This assessment revealed significant alignment between carcinosarcoma DEGs and human metaplastic gene signature data (NES = 1.615 and FDR 0.002) (Supplementary Fig. 3f [this file] ). 
Normalized protein loading and transformed linear values were used to determine fold change and later log 2 transformed fold change values (Supplementary Data 7 [this file] ). 
Further, using a tet-inducible system, we showed that knock-down of leads to a parallel decrease in mRNA expression of (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). 
PHA-665752 treatment and targeting of MET significantly reduced cell viability in a dose-dependent and metaplastic carcinosarcoma-specific manner (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). 
PI3K pathway components exhibited high protein levels in RPPA and CyTOF analysis of metaplastic carcinosarcoma tumors (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] ), likely activated by post-transcriptional regulation (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). We found that metaplastic carcinosarcoma cell lines showed a marked reduction in cell viability with low doses of Dactolisib, which was not recapitulated in the 4T1 TNBC-like cell line (Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] ). 
We used RNA-Seq analysis of MpBC patient tumor biopsies, acquired at the time of enrollment in the clinical trial, to generate a human TRIM24 metaplastic breast cancer signature using the SIGNATURE system, as previously described , and developed a heatmap representation of the TRIM24 metaplastic signature expressed by murine metaplastic carcinosarcoma (M) versus carcinoma tumors (C) (Fig. 6a [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Data 8 [this file] ). 
Further, TRIM24-signature-high-scoring MpBC tumors (red dots) also showed a higher percentage of vimentin IHC staining, indicative of EMT, compared to non-metaplastic TNBC tumors (Fig. 6d [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Data 9 [this file] ). RCB-II and RCB-III tumors had higher TRIM24 scores, but did not achieve statistical significance due to low numbers of chemosensitive tumors (Fig. 6e [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Data 9 [this file] ), indicating little to no response to primary chemotherapy. In the subtypes of TNBCs, described by Lehman et al. , we found that MpBC tumors with significant TRIM24 metaplastic scores were classified mainly as immunomodulatory (IM) and mesenchymal (M*) subtypes (Fig. 6f [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Data 9 [this file] ). 
Non-MpBC and MpBC subtyped patient biopsies were further classified by Vanderbilt-Based subtyping (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). Human mitochondrial protein IHC for nonglycosylated components of mitochondria distinguishes human tissue in the mouse mammary environment of PDX models (Supplementary Fig. 5b, d [this file] ). MpBC PDXs have high levels of TRIM24 expression in both nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, while non-MpBC TNBC PDXs have more variable TRIM24 expression (Fig. 7a [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). 
However, IACS9571 bromodomain inhibitor was further developed as a VHL-ligand-based proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC), which proved to be an effective TRIM24 protein degrader (dTRIM24) in cellulo ( and Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] ). The dTRIM24 drug successfully degraded TRIM24 compared to eTRIM24 and DMSO (Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] ). To ascertain potential relevance of TRIM24 targeting in human TNBC, we compared the ability of dTRIM24 and eTRIM24 to impact viability of TNBC PDX tumorspheres, both MpBC and non-MpBC (Fig. 7a [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ), using a high-throughput drug screening platform (Fig. 7b [rid=Fig7] ). 
Comparison of RNA expression changes in MMTV-driven tumors, as well as to publicly available human MpBC ( GSE57544 (GSE57544) ), revealed significant concurrence with our derived TRIM24 Metaplastic signature score (Supplementary Fig. 3d, e [this file] ). 
A transposon vector was constructed bearing a human promoter-driven cassette 5′ of a FLAG-tagged cDNA ( ) (Supplementary Fig. S1a [this file] and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ) . Transgenic ( ) founder mice were identified by PCR of tail genomic DNA (Fig S1b), using primers listed in Supplementary Data 1 [this file] . mice were bred with the Tg(MMTV-cre)4Mam (The Jackson laboratory, stock 003553) recombinase mouse line D ( ) for Cre-mediated excision of the floxed stop cassette to drive expression of transgenic in mammary epithelial cells. 
The discordant reads of these samples are included in Supplementary Data 3 [this file] . 
Immunoblotting was performed using standard techniques for antibodies listed in Supplementary Data 1 [this file] . Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and qRT-PCR was performed as described previously using primers listed in Supplementary Data 2 [this file] . 
This resulted in a list of 2006 genes (Supplementary Data 6 [this file] ). 
Samples were probed with 244 antibodies listed in Supplementary Data 7 [this file] . 
We then compared the scores between the metaplastic tumors (defined by a pathologist) and the non-metaplastic ones using a two-tailed T-test via GraphPad Prism (Supplementary Data 8 [this file] ).",pdf,Mammary-specific expression of,XML,,,,,,,

Each TMTsixplex label reagent (#90066) was equilibrated at room temperature, dissolved in 41 μl anhydrous acetonitrile and added in a 50 μg-peptide sample (more details in Table S 1 [this file] ). 
All those different conditions were then mixed differentially in order to allow comparison between the different cell lines and the different treatments, resulting in different 6-plex TMT mixes (Table S 1 [this file] ). Significantly upregulated and downregulated proteins are presented as light and dark share of the circle, as well as the comparison between the sensitive and resistant cell lines (|z-score (ratio) ≥ 1.96|) (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] B, Tables S 2 [this file] .1–15, Tables S 3 [this file] .1–9). 
The readings were aligned to the human transcriptome constructed from the annotations from ENSEMBL (Homo sapiens version 98) (Table S 4 [this file] ). Gene quantification analysis revealed that the annotation contained 59,369 genes, with 23,313 detected in at least one sample (using a minimal quantification of 1 TPM) (Table S 5 [this file] ). The differential expression of transcripts and genes was obtained by comparing the specific data for each cell line compared to the control condition (Tables S 6 [this file] .1–15, Tables S 7 [this file] .1–9). 
We then looked in more detail at the effect of 5-FU on the proteo-transcriptome of the three sensitive CRC cell lines (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] , Tables S 2 [this file] and S 3 [this file] ). No statistically significant biological process was observed (Tables S 3 [this file] .1, S 7 [this file] .1). Regarding the HCT-116 cell line, after 5-FU treatment, there was a decrease in proteins involved in (GO:0000018) represented by H1FX, KPNA2, RIF1, HIST1H1C and RPA2 (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] D, in orange) and from (GO:0044391) included RPS29, MRPS28, RPLP1 and RPL37A (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] D, in purple) (Tables S 3 [this file] .4). There was also an increase in proteins involved in (KEGG:04115) [ 75 [rid=CR75] ] with SFN, BAX, SERPINB5, CDKN1A, RRM2B and TP53I3 (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] E, in blue) and from mitochondria (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] E, in yellow) including TYMS, the main enzyme targeted by 5-FU (Table S 3 [this file] .4). At the transcriptomic level, in response to 5-FU, we noted the strong downregulation of transcripts corresponding to proteins involved in the (GO:1903047) (Table S 7 [this file] .4, Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] F, in blue). Finally, for the HT-29 cell line, no statistically significant biological process was observed at the proteomic level (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] G, H, Tables S 3 [this file] .7) but some upregulated proteins from (GO:0030667) can be observed (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] H, in green). 
The major observation is that the induction of chemoresistance to 5-FU largely affects the proteins involved in RNA metabolism (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] A, B; Tables S 3 [this file] .3, S3.6, S3.9). 
At the transcriptome level, there are few transcripts common to the three cell lines after induction of resistance to 5-FU (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] C, D) and therefore no significant common biological processes were identified (Tables S 7 [this file] .3, S7.6, S7.9).",zip,Downregulation of KRAB zinc finger proteins in 5-fluorouracil resistant colorectal cancer cells,XML,,,,,,,

In order to determine the sensitivity to ionizing radiations, these cell lines were exposed to 2, 4, 6 and 8 Gy at D + 1 post-seeding and colony forming units (CFU) were counted after an 8-day or 12-day incubation (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] A; Fig. S 1 [this file] A).

Principal component analysis (PCA) based on the LFQ/NSAF abundance values for a given protein, at both time points revealed completely separate clusters representing homozygous mutant and wild-type samples (Supplementary Information: Fig. 1A, B [this file] ). At P14, a total of 4080 unique peptides were identified, 97% of which contained phosphorylated residues in the phospho-serine/threonine scan, an average of 2239 unique phosphopeptides per sample (Supplementary Data 1: Table 3 [this file] ). At P40, a total of 8468 unique peptides were identified, 90% of which contained phosphorylated residues, with an average of 5783 unique phosphopeptides per sample (Supplementary Data 1: Table 4 [this file] ). PCA, based on the LFQ abundance values for a given phosphopeptide, at both time points revealed non-overlapping clusters of homozygous mutant and wild-type samples (Supplementary Information: Fig. 1C, D [this file] ). 
Surprisingly, we found no intersection between the P14 and P40 proteome (0% overlap; Fig. 2A [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Information: Table 1 [this file] ). For the phospho-serine/threonine scan, we found 21 molecules of all input molecules shared between time points (13% overlap; Fig.2B [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Information: Table 1 [this file] ). For the phospho-tyrosine scan, we found 25 molecules of all input molecules shared between time points (48% overlap; Fig. 2C [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Information: Table 1 [this file] ). Furthermore, 49 molecules were shared between the P14 and P40 transcriptome datasets (7% overlap; Fig. 2D [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Information: Table 1 [this file] ). 
Surprisingly, we found minimal intersection across these datasets; 8% overlap for P14 datasets and 3% overlap for P40 datasets (Fig. 2E [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Information: Table 1 [this file] ). We proceeded to assess the overlap between the transcriptome and proteome within each time point and found 1 (i.e., 2% overlap) and 30 (i.e., 4% overlap) intersecting molecules at P14 and P40, respectively (Fig. 2F [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Information: Table 1 [this file] ). 
In the proteome, the top implicated canonical pathways broadly involve phosphoinositide metabolism (i.e., 3′-phosphoinositide Biosynthesis) or neurological pathways, such as GABA Receptor Signaling and Glutamate Receptor Signaling (Fig. 3A [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Data 2: Tables S1 [this file] , S2 [this file] ). In the phosphoproteome, the top canonical pathways generally involve neurological and cancer processes or major cellular signaling cascades: Molecular Mechanisms of Cancer, Synaptic Long Term Potentiation, Neuregulin Signaling and cAMP-mediated Signaling (Fig. 3B [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Data 2: Tables 3 [this file] , 4 [this file] ). Overall, a broad qualitative appraisal of these enriched pathways and functional networks consistently implicate PTEN signaling, overgrowth or proliferative processes, and neurological process, especially those related to synaptic transmission or neuroinflammation (Supplemental Data 4 [this file] ). 
We extracted the largest STRING networks from each –omic dataset at each time points and analyzed the network statistics using Cytoscape (Supplementary Information: Fig. 2 [this file] ).",pdf,Transcriptome-(phospho)proteome characterization of brain of a germline model of cytoplasmic-predominant Pten expression with autism-like phenotypes,XML,,,,,,,

The and genes were detected with both short and long amplicon PCR (Bio-Rad C1000 Touch, USA) (the primers are listed in Supporting Information Table S1 [this file] ). 
The temperature profile included one cycle at 95 °C for 2 min, then 40 cycles of the steps that included 95 °C for 10 s, an annealing temperature (Table S1 [this file] ) for 20 s, and finally 72 °C for either 60 s (long amplicons) or 20 s (short amplicons). 
In addition, an extremely high concentration (30 mg/L) was also applied in this study to test the high chlorine resistance of in terms of MIC analyses (Table S2 [this file] ). The frequency of eARGs transformation was ~1.5 × 10 after 6 h (Fig. S2 [this file] ), and was maximized when the plasmid concentration was greater than 0.8 ng/μL (Fig. S3 [this file] ). 
Both chloramine and free chlorine could significantly increase the number of transformants and the transformation frequency of plasmid-encoded eARGs in System 1 (Fig. 2a, b [rid=Fig2] , and Fig. S4 [this file] ). For instance, concentrations of chlorine residuals decreased to 2.7 or 1.4 mg/L after 6 h of treatment when initial levels of 30 mg/L of chloramine or free chlorine were applied respectively (Fig. S5 [this file] ). 
All the transformants exhibited increased resistance against the two antibiotics (Table S2 [this file] ), indicating the expression of the Amp and Tet resistance genes after uptake of the pWH1266 plasmid. In contrast, the wild-type was susceptible to antibiotics Amp and Tet (Table S2 [this file] ). 
However, this overestimation can be ruled out, since the total number of recipients did not increase during the 6-h period (Fig. S4 [this file] and Table S3 [this file] ), this indicating that the increased frequency was facilitated by transformation, rather than VGT. 
As expected, after exposure to chloramine or free chlorine the bacterial ROS levels decreased significantly in comparison with those detected under aerobic conditions (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] , Fig. S6 [this file] , = 4.1 × 10 –1.5 × 10 ) to the levels of the non-disinfectant controls. 
Under aerobic conditions, both chloramine and free chlorine (30 mg/L) could generate the ClO• radical with strong intensity (Fig. S7 [this file] ). 
We further employed transcriptional analysis to provide molecular evidence that the exposure to the chlorine-based disinfectants at 10 mg/L triggered oxidative stress in the recipient strains (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] , Table S4 [this file] ). Furthermore, the expression of core genes related to DNA integration and repair showed increased transcript levels under the exposure of chloramine or free chlorine (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] , Table S5 [this file] ). 
In particular, SodA and Ahp family proteins (AhpC and AphF) are antioxidant enzymes that play a role in the protection from ROS attack [ 39 [rid=CR39] ], were upregulated (Table S6 [this file] ). 
Damage of the cell membrane caused by the disinfectants was further assessed by analysis of protein and gene expression in the recipient (Tables S7 [this file] , S8 [this file] ). 
The transcription levels of stress-related genes ( ) and competence-related genes ( ) were upregulated under the exposure of 10 mg/L disinfectants (Table S9 [this file] ). In addition, when exposing to chloramine or free chlorine under anaerobic conditions, no significant variations of live/dead cell percentages were seen compared with the non-disinfectant control (Fig. S8 [this file] ). 
Although the intracellular ROS generation dramatically decreased after removing the remaining disinfectants (Fig. S9 [this file] ), the increased cell membrane permeabilization remained. 
For example, the highest fold change was only 2.8-fold under anaerobic conditions (as shown in Fig. S10 [this file] ), while it could reach 40-fold aerobically (Fig. 4a, b [rid=Fig4] ). However, it should also be noted that compared with the non-disinfectant control, a significant enhancement of membrane permeability was shown under the exposure of free chlorine anaerobically (Fig. S10 [this file] ).",docx,Chlorine disinfection facilitates natural transformation through ROS-mediated oxidative stress,XML,,,,,,,

Following analysis with Peptide Collapse PlugIn, the resulting quantified data for 3531 phosphosites (Additional files 5 [this file6] and 6 [this file7] ) were used for further analysis. 
Quantified datasets were processed as explained in Supplementary Methods [this file] , and used for statistical analysis. 
Equivalence tests were performed as detailed in Supplementary Methods [this file] . 
Additional methods to characterize N-terminal peptides and to perform biological process and pathway enrichment are described in Supplementary Methods [this file] . 
Protein-level and N termini average CV were below 6 and 21% respectively (Supplementary Fig. S 1 [this file] F and G). 
An overlap of proteins represented in non-leukemic and diseased categories (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] A and B) revealed a large protein subset common to patients and PDX was not detected in non-leukemic samples. 
The average Spearman’s correlation scores for protein abundance in T-ALL patient and corresponding xenograft mice was 0.83 (SD=0.06) (Supplementary Fig. S 3 [this file] A), with lower correlations (average=0.67, SD=0.06) observed between primary leukemias with lower disease burden and their matched PDXs. B-cell leukemia samples had average correlation score of 0.88 (SD=0.02) (Supplementary Fig. S 3 [this file] B). Proteins involved in known signaling pathways affected in pediatric leukemia also correlated strongly between primary and PDX leukemias (Supplementary Fig. S 3 [this file] A and B). 
Although matched patient and PDX did not co-cluster, a positive correlation (B-ALL average=0.62, SD=0.06; T-ALL average=0.60, SD=0.03) was retained between individual patients and their corresponding xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S 4 [this file] ). S 4 [this file] B and D). 
We first compared biological processes and pathways enriched in proteins that were uniquely identified in patients or in PDXs (Supplementary Fig. S 6 [this file] A and B). S 6 [this file] C and S 7 [this file] A). In PDXs, processes linked to cell division and regulation of cyclin-dependent protein serine/threonine kinase activity were enhanced (Supplementary Fig. S 7 [this file] B). 
Similar to PDXs, B- and T-ALL cell lines lacked or minimally expressed proteins including serpins and S100 proteins, that regulate immune and inflammatory response systems in patients (Supplementary Fig. S 8 [this file] A). Leukemia in 380 CDX localized to the liver (93% human cells) and not spleen (16% human cells), and CDX liver best reflected the proteome of B-ALL 380 in comparison to xenograft spleen (Supplementary Fig. S 8 [this file] B). When compared with 380 cell lines, 380 CDX spleen and liver had higher amounts of MCM2 proliferation marker, while PCNA showed an increased but not significant trend (Supplementary Fig. S 8 [this file] C). 
Additionally, RB1 protein levels were similar in the multiple xenograft samples from patients B-02, B-06, and B-07, which were not analyzed by targeted NGS (Supplementary Fig. S 9 [this file] A). 
This was also the case for patients with more than one expanded xenograft mice (Supplementary Fig. S 9 [this file] B). The absolute fold change for quantified proteins between paired patients and PDX is shown in Supplementary Fig. S 10 [this file] A. We identified 389 and quantified 302 (Supplementary Table S 7 [rid=MOESM8] ), with proteins CLUH and RNF138 showing the strongest abundance changes between patient and PDX. (Supplementary Fig. S 10 [this file] B). The total number of and targets showing protein abundance change greater than 2-fold in each patient/PDX pair is depicted in Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] C. 
We found that total protein (r =0.94) and phosphopeptide (r =0.90) intensities correlated better ( -value< 0.0001) between the patient and xenograft groups while N termini abundance correlated moderately (r =0.73, p-value< 0.0001) (Supplementary Fig. S 11 [this file] A – F). The unique cleavage pattern of MCM5 in ALL patients and corresponding PDXs further substantiated the existence of proteolytic fingerprints that are indistinguishable at the protein level (Supplementary Fig. S 11 [this file] G). 
Neo N termini profiles showed a loss in caspase 1 (CASP1) proteolytic activities in blast cells after transplantation, and a gain in elastase (ELNE) activities in xenografts (Supplementary Fig. S 11 [this file] H and Supplementary Table S 8 [rid=MOESM9] ). 
In our smaller cohort of two T-ALL patients (blast count> 80%) and corresponding PDXs, 194 neo N termini were dysregulated (189 upregulated, and 9 downregulated) between patients and PDXs (Supplementary Table S 10 [this file1] , Supplementary Figs. S 12 [this file] A and B). Enrichment analysis showed similar processes and complexes associated with protein processing and maturation (Supplementary Fig. S 12 [this file] C), comparable sequence motifs and a similar protease map (Supplementary Fig. S 12 [this file] D-F), as was detected for B-ALL patients. 
A similar protease network was associated with neo N termini alterations in B-ALL (Supplementary Fig. S 13 [this file] A). 
While the majority of these proteins were stable between PDX and patients, five proteins critical for cytokine signalling were markedly deficient or missing in B- and T- cell xenograft leukemias, as well as in 380 cell line-derived xenograft (Supplementary Fig. S 13 [this file] ).",zip,PDX models reflect the proteome landscape of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia but divert in select pathways,XML,,,,,,,

For both EV samples, the elution profile showed peaks in particle concentrations in fractions 6–8, suggesting that these fractions contained the EVs (EMS1, Fig. S2 [this file] ). 
Afterwards, protein and particle concentration of pooled SEC fractions (F1–F5, F6–F8, and two-by-two for F9 to F15) were analyzed to determine which fractions had the highest number of particles and the least amount of protein (EMS1, Fig. S3 [this file] ). 
In addition, both EV samples statistically contained an increased number of identified proteins in comparison to plasma samples, in which 224 proteins were identified (EMS1, Fig. S4 [this file] ). 
To observe how depletion impacted the highly abundant plasma proteins in EVs, we looked at the top 20 quantified proteins in N and D EVs (EMS1, Fig. S5 [this file] ).

We first aimed at identifying the feature variations that were the most associated with time using Longitudinal Gaussian Processes (LGPR; Timonen et al., 2021 [rid=ref71] ; Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] – 4 [this file] ). 
Next, clusters with similar profiles were merged and regrouped in larger clusters named A–D for both transcriptomic and proteomic data ( Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] , 2 [this file] ). 
Moreover, between 12 h and 18 h 45 min, 1,790 genes (177 up- and 309 down-regulated, |log FC| > 1) and 399 proteins (17 up-, including five ON proteins, and 17 down-regulated, including eight OFF proteins, |log FC | > 1) are differentially expressed (adj -value < 0.05; Supplementary Tables 5 [this file] , 6 [this file] ). 
To functionally characterize clusters, pathway enrichment analyses ( Huang et al., 2009 [rid=ref28] ) were next performed with the groups of transcripts/proteins that constitute each cluster using the KEGG and GO databases ( Supplementary Tables 7 [this file] – 10 [this file] ). 
The expression of these genes remained stable between 4 and 12 h, increased from 12 h to 18 h 45 min, and then decreased from 18 h 45 min to 26 h of culture ( Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, 2022 [rid=ref36] ; Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
This is consistent with the sudden decrease of the gene (cluster A) expression (Log FC = −4.7) and of the PutA protein (cluster A) synthesis (Log FC = −1) between 12 and 22 h ( Supplementary Tables 5 [this file] , 6 [this file] ). 
Similarly, while the expression of , encoding a putative glutamate transporter ( Keidel et al., 2018 [rid=ref34] ) decreased between 12 h and 18 h 45 min (Log2FC = −1.8), a marked expression increase of this gene was also observed between 18 h 45 min and 22 h (Log2FC = +2.0), ( Supplementary Tables 5 [this file] , 6 [this file] ). 
In the present study, the expression of most TCA cycle genes and the synthesis of corresponding proteins increased at 18 h 45 min of culture (cluster D; Figure 6B [rid=fig6] ; Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] , 2 [this file] ). 
Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were used to monitor transcripts and proteins involved in aP vaccine antigen production throughout culture ( Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] , 2 [this file] , 5 [this file] , 6 [this file] ). 
For this purpose, a list of 207 (log FC < −2) (log FC > 2; Supplementary Tables 11 [this file] , 12 [this file] ) was selected from the literature ( Moon et al., 2017 [rid=ref45] ; Coutte et al., 2020 [rid=ref10] ). 
In our study, to discover new virulence regulation mechanisms in . , the longitudinal gene expression profiles of these 20 putative regulators were compared to the profile of 16 recently described without BvgA-binding sites ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ; Coutte et al., 2020 [rid=ref10] ). 
A differential gene expression analysis, between 4 and 8 h of culture, revealed 19 downregulated (log FC < −1, -value < 0.05) and 62 upregulated genes (log FC > 1, -value < 0.05; Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, this starvation was concomitant with the starvation of ascorbic acid in the extracellular medium ( Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ; Supplementary Figure 5 [rid=SM5] ).",XLSX,Deep longitudinal multi-omics analysis of,XML,,,,,,,

There was a significant association between copy number and breast cancer subtypes (Kruskal-Wallis test; p = 0.007), with luminal tumors displaying a higher proportion of loss than the other subtypes ( Figure S1B [this file] ). Indeed, copy numbers were significantly lower in luminal tumors or ERα-positive tumors than tumors of the other subtypes or ERα-negative tumors ( Figure S1C [this file] ). The copy number of correlates with its mRNA levels (r = 0.69, p < 0.0001; Figure S1D [this file] ), suggesting a possible causal relationship. 
Intriguingly, low mRNA levels were associated with poor survival in patients with ERα-positive breast cancer in the KM plotter dataset (patients divided at lower tertile: hazard ratio [HR] = 1.27, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04–1.54, p = 0.017; not significant for patients divided at median or quartile) and in METABRIC dataset (divided at median: HR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.01–1.32, p = 0.037; or lower tertile: HR = 1.16, 95% CI = 1.01–1.35, p = 0.036; Figures 1B [rid=F1] and S2A [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ). No association was observed in patients who were ERα-negative or that were stratified based on the status of progesterone receptor or HER2 in both datasets ( Figures 1B [rid=F1] and S2A [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ). When patients in these two datasets were stratified into the intrinsic molecular subtypes, a significant association between low mRNA levels and poor survival was observed in patients with luminal B (KM plotter samples divided at lower tertile: HR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.08–2.00, p = 0.016; METABRIC samples divided at median: HR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.20–1.88, p = 0.0005; Figures S2B [this file] and S2C [this file] ), suggesting that the shorter survival in patients who were ERα-positive might be mainly attributed to the luminal B subpopulation. Further, analysis of TCGA breast cancer data identified that gene copy loss was associated with a trend (although not statistically significant) toward shorter progression-free survival in patients with luminal A or luminal B ( Figure S2D [this file] ) and a significantly shorter survival in patients with luminal B in METABRIC cohort (HR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.01–1.60, p = 0.043; Figure S2E [this file] ). No trend was noted in patients of basal, HER2-enriched, or normal-like subtype ( Figures S2D [this file] and S2E [this file] ). 
The efficiency of the siRNA was presented in Figures S3A [this file] – S3C [this file] . Depletion of enhanced viability consistently in 5 ERα-positive breast cancer cell lines, MCF7, MDA-MB-361, MDA-MB-175, BT474, and T47D ( Figures 1C [rid=F1] and S3D [this file] ). In addition, cell migration and invasion capabilities were enhanced upon loss in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 ( Figure 1D [rid=F1] ) but not in HER2-enriched or basal cells ( Figures 1D [rid=F1] and S3E [this file] ). 
The functional impacts of loss were further examined in MCF7 cells with stable knockdown ( Figure S4A [this file] ). Consistently, increases in viability, long-term clonogenic growth, migration, and invasion could be observed in these cells compared with empty-vector-expressing or parental cells ( Figures S4B [this file] – S4D [this file] ). The weight and volume of the depleted tumors were both higher than that of the vector tumors ( Figures 1E [rid=F1] and S4E [this file] ). 
Binding between AKTIP and AKT was not detected by immunoprecipitation experiments, in which we included a positive control HOOK1, which has been reported to bind AKTIP ( Figure S5A [this file] ). Moreover, the lack of effect of AKTIP on AKT signaling was observed in HER2-overexpressing SKBR3 cells ( Figure S5B [this file] ). 
Real-time PCR revealed no significant difference in ESR1 mRNA levels upon knockdown in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells ( Figure S5C [this file] ), demonstrating that transcriptional regulation unlikely contributes to the increased ERα protein level. Increased protein stability of ERα was further supported by a decrease in ERα poly-ubiquitination after knockdown in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells ( Figures 3B [rid=F3] and S5D [this file] ). 
Depletion of cullin-associated and neddylation-dissociated protein 1 (CAND1), which was validated to bind AKTIP ( Figure S5E [this file] ), led to a reduction of ERα protein levels in -depleted cells ( Figure 3D [rid=F3] ). Our data showed that the Hook proteins were not involved in ERα stabilization by AKTIP ( Figure S5F [this file] ). Consistently, siRNA reduced ERα protein levels in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells ( Figures 3E [rid=F3] and S5G [this file] ), with an increase in ERα ubiquitination ( Figure 3F [rid=F3] ). siRNA of and , which have been previously shown to regulate ERα, had no significant effect on loss-induced ERα levels ( Figure S5H [this file] ). 
Binding between ERα and CAND1 could not be detected, whereas binding between ERα and a known protein binding partner HSP70 was observed in the same experiment ( Figure S5I [this file] ). 
Remarkably, 89% of the 91 DEGs identified in MCF7 were defined as estrogen-responsive genes based on the transcriptomic data in the Signaling Pathways Project ( Figure 4E [rid=F4] ; Table S2 [this file] ). We validated 12 DEGs with high or low fold change and documented functional roles in cancers by real-time PCR ( Figure S6A [this file] ). Notably, the expression levels of classical ERα targets ( , , ) were increased in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells but not in SKBR3 after knockdown ( Figures 4G [rid=F4] and S6A [this file] ). The mRNA levels of in MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells were not altered upon β-estradiol stimulation, suggesting that is not a transcriptional target of ERα and that there is no feedback from ERα to AKTIP ( Figure S6B [this file] ). 
Similarly, loss of increased the protein levels of SGK3 and its phosphorylation at T320 in both MCF7 and MDA-MB-361 cells ( Figure 4I [rid=F4] ), whereas inhibition of ERα by fulvestrant or tamoxifen (4-OH-Tam) abrogated the increases ( Figure S6C [this file] ). We next examined whether the upregulation of SGK3 plays a role in sustaining ERα activation. siRNA-mediated knockdown of did not alter the extent of ERα upregulation upon loss ( Figure S6D [this file] ). 
We investigated the drug responses of -depleted cells toward ERα or JAK2/STAT3 inhibition. -depleted MCF7 or MDA-MB-361 cells were more resistant to fulvestrant or 4-OH-Tam compared with vector control cells ( Figures 6A [rid=F6] and S7A [this file] ). Interestingly, among the group of patients with ERα-positive breast cancer who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy, patients with low mRNA levels had a higher risk of developing recurrence, further supporting that -low tumors may be endocrine resistant ( Figure 6B [rid=F6] ). -depleted MCF7 or MDA-MB-361 cells also displayed resistance toward JAK2 inhibition when cells were treated with AZD1480 alone ( Figures 6C [rid=F6] and S7A [this file] ). 
Remarkably, the addition of a fixed concentration of JAK2 inhibitor AZD1480 increased the sensitivity of -depleted MCF7 or MDA-MB-361 cells to fulvestrant or 4-OH-Tam ( Figures 6D [rid=F6] and S7B [this file] ), demonstrating that JAK2/STAT3 inhibition can resensitize -depleted cells to ERα inhibition. AZD1480 had no effect on the dose-response curve of fulvestrant or 4-OH-Tam in vector control or mock-transfected cells ( Figures 6D [rid=F6] and S7B [this file] ). Similar observations were obtained when cells were treated with STAT3 inhibitor C188–9 ( Figures 6E [rid=F6] and S7C [this file] ).

Detailed information on bacterial strains and their construction is listed in Appendix Supplementary Table S2 [this file] . 
Plasmids and DNA oligonucleotides are listed in Appendix Supplementary Table S2 [this file] and S3 [this file] , respectively. 
Fold enrichment in the -tagged samples compared to untagged control samples was calculated using the CLC ‘Differential Expression for RNA-Seq’ tool ( Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). 
The oligonucleotides used for probing are listed in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . The oligonucleotides used for qRT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . 
Oligos used for depletion are indicated in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . 
Primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . synthesized mRNA was mixed with or without the sRNA in a 10 μl reaction volume following the manufacturer’s instructions. 
The Minora algorithm of PD2.2 was applied for relative protein abundance quantification ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). 
Analogous to the genomes of and , the gene of is located between the (encoding a protease) and (encoding a methionine-(R)-sulfoxide reductase) genes and its transcription is driven by single promoter located 50 bps upstream of the translation start site ( Supplementary Figure S1A [this file] ; ( 62 [rid=B62] )). We detected nearly constant ProQ production under all tested conditions with a mild increase in protein expression under stationary phase growth conditions ( Supplementary Figure S1B [this file] ) and similar results were obtained when we probed mRNA levels using qRT-PCR ( Supplementary Figure S1C [this file] ). We found that growth of this mutant was comparable to wild-type cells and plasmid-borne overexpression of did not affect growth either ( Supplementary Figure S1D [this file] ). 
We discovered 496 mRNA and 60 sRNA ligands at low cell density (OD of 0.2) and 463 mRNA and 75 sRNA ligands at high cell density (OD of 2.0) ( Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). In line with a previous report ( 23 [rid=B23] ), we discovered that 3′-UTRs of mRNAs were preferentially bound by ProQ ( Supplementary Figure S1E [this file] ). We further classified the sRNAs based on their genomic location, determining whether they were transcribed from intergenic regions (IGRs) or encoded within mRNA 5′-UTRs or 3′-UTRs ( Supplementary Figure S1F [this file] ). Analogous to ProQ, mutation or overexpression of did not affect growth of in rich media ( Supplementary Figure S1G [this file] ). 
The gene is located in the 3′-UTR of (encoding a major flagellin) in (Figure 2A [rid=F2] and Supplementary Figure S2A [this file] ) and was reported to accumulate as a ∼150 nt transcript ( 14 [rid=B14] ). Indeed, we discovered that Δ cells displayed reduced FlaX stability, whereas elevated ProQ levels increased its stability (Figure 2C [rid=F2] and Supplementary Figure S2B [this file] ). 
One representative gel is shown in Supplementary Figure S2B [this file] . 
Transcription of and is driven by a single promoter located upstream of the gene (Figure 2A [rid=F2] and ( 62 [rid=B62] )) and mutation of this promoter strongly reduced FlaX expression ( Supplementary Figure S2C [this file] ). In accordance, with these results we discovered that mutation of the RNase E recognition motif ( 49 [rid=B49] , 65 [rid=B65] ) at the 5′ end of inhibited accumulation of the full-length FlaX transcript ( Supplementary Figure S2D [this file] ). 
Again, we performed these experiments at low and high cell density (OD of 0.2 and 2.0, respectively), which revealed dozens of differentially expressed genes at both cell densities in Δ and FlaX overexpressing cells (Figure 3D [rid=F3] and Supplementary Figure S3A [this file] ). Indeed, we discovered that FlaX overexpression reduced the stability of the mRNA, when compared to a control sample ( Supplementary Figure S3B [this file] ). 
Analogous to the RIP-Seq experiments outlined above, we performed these analyses at low and high cell densities (OD of 0.2 and 2.0) allowing us to recover 299 484 and 117 561 ProQ-associated interactions, respectively (Figure 4A [rid=F4] and B [rid=F4] and Supplementary Figure S4A [this file] ). We quantified the respective interactions according to their genomic origin, i.e. mRNAs or sRNAs, which revealed that the majority (89%) of ProQ-associated interactions involved mRNAs, whereas only 3% of all interactions included sRNAs (8% of the interactions involved IGRs, Supplementary Figure S4B [this file] ). 
Quantification of data from two biological replicates is provided in Supplementary Figure S4C [this file] . 
Five of the nine reporters showed significant regulation by FlaX: , , and were repressed, whereas was induced (Figure 4D [rid=F4] and Supplementary Figure S4D–G [this file] ). Indeed, we discovered that FlaB levels were strongly increased under all growth conditions in the mutant and that protein abundance was largely restored when FlaX was expressed from a plasmid (Figure 4E [rid=F4] and Supplementary Figure S4C [this file] ). 
We also performed the reverse experiments using radio-labeled FlaX and increasing concentrations of synthesized 5′-UTR to determine the base-sequences in the sRNA ( Supplementary Figure S5A [this file] ). Of note, all base-pairing sites in ( Supplementary Figure S5B [this file] ) and FlaX ( Supplementary Figure S2A [this file] ) are highly conserved and analysis of the RIL-seq dataset using the ChimericFragments algorithm ( 48 [rid=B48] ) predicted RNA duplex formation of FlaX with three separate binding sites in the 5′-UTR, which we named BS1-3 (Figure 5C [rid=F5] – E [rid=F5] ). Importantly, expression of FlaX variants carrying compensatory mutations for each of the sites restored regulation (Figure 5F [rid=F5] and Supplementary Figure S5C [this file] ). 
In line with our previous data (Figure 5F [rid=F5] – H [rid=F5] ), we found that all five mutated variants were still repressed by FlaX, albeit to different levels ( Supplementary Figure S6A [this file] ). 
Western blot analysis showed that FlaB:GFP protein was readily detectable after 10 min of incubation and gradually increased with time (Figure 6C [rid=F6] and Supplementary Figure S6B [this file] and C [this file] ). Whereas none of the mutations impaired basal FlaB::GFP synthesis ( Supplementary Figure S6C [this file] ), we found that mutations 2 and 3 both reduced the effect of FlaX on translation, whereas mutation of base-pairing site 1 had no significant impact (Figure 6C [rid=F6] ). 
Consistent with the experiments using the reporter (Figure 5F [rid=F5] – H [rid=F5] ) and the translation assays (Figure 6C [rid=F6] and D [rid=F6] ), we discovered that mutation of binding site 2 in ( Supplementary Figure S6D [this file] ) or FlaX ( Supplementary Figure S6E [this file] ) had the strongest impact on toeprint intensity, followed by binding site 3 and binding site 1. 
As expected, addition of L-arabinose to Δ or Δ / cells carrying a control plasmid did not affect flaggelin mRNA expression (Figure 7A [rid=F7] and B [rid=F7] and Supplementary Figure S7A–D [this file] ). Plasmid-borne production of FlrA in Δ cells resulted in rapid activation of mRNA reaching maximal expression already 15 min post induction (Figure 7A [rid=F7] ) and a similar pattern was observed for FlaX ( Supplementary Figure S7A [this file] ). In comparison, expression of was delayed displaying highest levels 30 min ( , ) or 60 min after ( , ) after addition of the inducer (Figure 7B [rid=F7] and Supplementary Figure S7B–D [this file] ). 
Indeed, using scanning electron microscopy, we discovered that Δ mutants display elevated numbers of unflagellated cells, when compared to isogenic wild-type cells ( Supplementary Figure S7E [this file] ). 
The gene is conserved in many ( Supplementary Figure S2A [this file] ), suggesting that similar regulatory mechanisms for flagella synthesis could be relevant here as well. The homolog of FlaB in and is FlaA and indeed the FlaX binding sites in the 5′-UTRs of their corresponding mRNAs are highly conserved ( Supplementary Figure S5B [this file] ). 
Our list of ProQ-associated sRNAs contains a large fraction of 3′-UTR-derived sRNAs (Figure 1D [rid=F1] and Supplementary Figure S1E [this file] ), including Vcr077 and Vcr078 (Figure 1C [rid=F1] ), which are located in the 3′-UTRs of the and flagellin genes, respectively. Both sRNAs share sequence similarity with FlaX ( Supplementary Figure S7F [this file] ) and are produced by ribonucleolytic cleavage ( 62 [rid=B62] ). Indeed, we discovered that Vcr077 and Vcr078 both inhibited FlaE::GFP expression and Vcr077 also inhibited FlaA::GFP, whereas Vcr078 negatively affected FlaC::GFP levels ( Supplementary Figure S7G [this file] ). 
In accordance, we found that repression of FlaB::GFP by FlaX in a mutant was only mildly reduced (∼2.5-fold) and a similar effect was detected for cells lacking the genes encoding both major RNA chaperones ProQ and Hfq ( Supplementary Figure S7H [this file] ). Second, when comparing the fraction of recovered RNA duplexes according to their genomic origin, i.e., mRNAs and sRNAs, in our ProQ (Figure 4A [rid=F4] and B [rid=F4] ) and Hfq ( 46 [rid=B46] ) RIL-Seq datasets, we discovered that the vast majority (91%) of ProQ-associated interactions involved base-pairing between two mRNAs, whereas only 9% of all interactions included sRNAs ( Supplementary Figure S7I [this file] ).",zip,ProQ-associated small RNAs control motility in,XML,,,,,,,

Furthermore, Rhein treatment showed an overall reduction in the expression of exemplary pro-fibrotic response targets (Supplementary Fig. 2A [this file] ; ) and increased expression pointing towards a higher MMP:TIMP ratio. 
The expression status of known positive and negative regulators of the G2/M phase derived from the overall gene expression analyses pointed towards an impact of cell cycle progression in Rhein-mediated phenotype modulation (Supplementary Fig. 2B [this file] ). 
While was induced and differentially regulated on transcriptional level following Rhein treatment (Supplementary Fig. 2A [this file] ), intriguingly, TP53 was not differentially regulated, indicating a posttranslational mechanism leading to increased p53 abundance. In accordance, nodal cell cycle stages of G1/S and G2/M transition were differentially regulated in the comparisons (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). Surprisingly, HDAC expression levels derived from holistic gene expression analyses throughout all members of the HDAC family was unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 2C [this file] ). Rhein then is a more efficient HDAC enzymatic activity inhibitor than the commonly used inhibitors in a direct mode that even additive specifically in HDAC class I (Supplement Fig. 4 [this file] ), or SIRT (HDAC class III) (Supplement Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
Dose-response analyses revealed a concentration-dependent effect of Rhein on selected cardiac fibrosis-relevant proteins and mRNAs (Supplementary Fig. 6A–C [this file] ). Consistent with the dose-dependent reduction of TGFβ1-promoted induction of (Supplementary Fig. 6D [this file] ) Rhein also decreased the protein abundance of αSMA (Fig. 6C [rid=Fig6] ; 15 µM: 113%, p < 0.05; 35 µM: 49%, p < 0.0001). However, TGFβ1 target SMAD3 were not affected by Rhein on protein or mRNA level (Supplementary Fig. 7A–D [this file] ). HCF-v pre-treated with Rhein for 24 h prior to 30 min incubation with TGFβ1, demonstrated decreased abundance and expression of TGFβ receptor I (Supplementary Fig. 6E,F [this file] ) along with significantly decreased phosphorylation of SMAD2 at Ser465/467 by 50% (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6B [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Fig. 7E [this file] ). In line, SMAD-specific E3 ubiquitin ligase SMURF2 but not SMURF1 protein stability increased in parallel (Supplementary Fig. 8A–D [this file] ).",pdf,"Rhein, a novel Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor with antifibrotic potency in human myocardial fibrosis",XML,,,,,,,

Analysis of the chromatin landscape of JAK2V617F-positive MEPs, but not LSK or GMPs (data not shown), showed similar enrichment of the TNF/NF-κB signaling pathway at both TSS and enhancers compared to control cells ( Figures 1F [href=#F1] and S1B [href=this file] ), further highlighting an important role of an NF-κB-dependent regulatory network in MPN pathogenesis.
See also Figure S1 [href=this file] and Table S1 [href=#SD2] .
Detailed information about the creation of sub-networks and a list of gene sets can be found in , Figure S2 [href=this file] and Table S1 [href=#SD2] . See also , Figure S2 [href=this file] , and Tables S2 [href=#SD3] and S3 [href=#SD4] .
We next assessed for pathway enrichment by performing GSEA and subsequently identified key optimal sub-networks ( Figures S2A and B [href=this file] ) ( Bader and Hogue, 2003 [href=#R6] ). Consistent with the finding of dysregulated TNF/NF-κB pathway signaling in MF progenitors by gene expression and chromatin state analysis, integrated analysis of gene expression and H3K27ac occupancy data revealed a significant association between epigenetic and gene transcription data ( Figures 2E, 2F [href=#F2] , and S2C [href=this file] ), suggesting integrated epigenetic and transcriptional networks that regulate inflammatory signaling in MF progenitors. We therefore assessed for the presence of STAT3 and NF-κB binding sites ( Figure S2D [href=this file] ) in the regulatory regions of DEGs in MPLW515L-positive and JAK2V617F-positive MPN cells ( Table S2 [href=#SD3] ). Notably, we found a strong co-occurrence and enrichment for canonical p65/NF-κB and STAT3 DNA bindings sites in DEGs in both models ( Figures 2G [href=#F2] and S2E [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S3 [href=this file] .
Interestingly, while both mice receiving JQ1 and ruxolitinib alone showed a reduction in NF-κB pathway activation, the effect was significantly more potent when both drugs were administered as combination therapy ( Figures 3E [href=#F3] and S3 [href=this file] ).
Furthermore, JQ1 therapy resulted in lower spleen weights, decreased EMH in liver and spleen, a reduction in reticulin fibrosis, and a decrease of the proportion of GFP-positive mutant cells in the peripheral blood (PB) ( Figures 4B–D [href=#F4] , and S4 [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S4 [href=this file] .
Clusters 3–5 are presented in Figure S5 [href=this file] . See also Figure S5 [href=this file] and Table S4 [href=#SD4] .
We identified five distinct clusters with each cluster associated with a specific therapeutic regimen ( Figures 5B [href=#F5] and S5A [href=this file] ). Notably, integration of ChIP-sequencing and RNA-sequencing data comparing wild-type and mutant MEPs revealed that genes in cluster 1 are significantly enriched for the top 1000 differential H3K27ac peaks (ranked based on DESeq2 statistics), the top 1000 differential H3K4me1 peaks, and genes which were up-regulated in mutant MEPs compared to wild-type MEPs (***p value <1e-6) ( Figures 5B [href=#F5] and S5A [href=this file] ). Genes in cluster 1 were significantly enriched for the JAK2/STAT signaling pathway (p value=1.8e-4), while genes in cluster 2 were significantly enriched for the NF-κB signaling pathway (p value =0.02) ( Figure S5B [href=this file] ).
Combined JAK/BET inhibition reduced WBC and spleen weights to a degree not observed by either therapy alone ( Figures 5C, D [href=#F5] and S5C [href=this file] ). Similar to our findings in MF mice, combined JAK/BET inhibition showed increased therapeutic efficacy in JAK2V617F-diseased mice compared to JQ1 and/or ruxolitinib monotherapy ( Figures 5G, 5H [href=#F5] , and S5D–F [href=this file] ). In addition, combined JAK/BET inhibition substantively decreased the number of erythroid progenitors in the bone marrow of primary JAK2V617F mice and led to a significant reduction of red cell blood parameters in JAK2V617F-mutant mice ( Figure S5D–F [href=this file] ).
Strikingly, combined JAK/BET inhibitor therapy completely eliminated fibrosis in MF mice ( Figures 6A, 6B [href=#F6] and S6A [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S6 [href=this file] , Tables S5 and S6 [href=#SD4] .
JQ1 prevented the development of JAK inhibitor persistence and JAK inhibitor persistent SET-2 cells remained sensitive to BET inhibition ( Figures 6D, 6E [href=#F6] , and S6B [href=this file] ).
Of note a subset of patient samples (3 out of 5) which required higher concentrations of ruxolitinib to block colony formation retained sensitivity to BET inhibition ( Figure S6C [href=this file] ). Genomic analysis of colonies from patients with multiple mutations, including high-risk MPN disease alleles ( ), showed that combined ruxolitinib/JQ1 therapy showed efficacy against all MPN clones including clones with multiple disease alleles ( Tables S5, S6 [href=#SD4] and Figure S6D [href=this file] ).
We found the raw p values of the GSEA analysis are found to be highly inflated ( Figure S2B [href=this file] ).
Mice were randomized based on HCT and PLT counts and treatment was performed for 28 days as indicated above with the exception that BET inhibitor JQ1 was administered on 7 days per week at 50 mg/kg ( Figure S5D–F [href=this file] ).

Network analysis found that several of the encoded proteins were part of shared regulatory networks in the nucleus and cytoplasm ( Supplementary Figure S4B [href=this file] ).
The changes in shared downregulated and upregulated transcripts (Figures 3 [href=#F3] and 4 [href=#F4] ) were validated by using RT-qPCR analysis employing gene-specific primer pairs ( Supplementary Table S10 [href=this file] ). Among the many RNAs shared across all senescence models, we validated 16 reduced and 12 increased transcripts (Figure 5A [href=#F5] and B) in replicative, IR-induced, Dox-induced and oncogene-induced senescence in WI-38 cells, as well as in replicative and IR-induced senescence in IMR-90 cells and IR-induced senescence in HUVEC and HAEC; additional validation in biological replicates is shown in Supplementary Figure S5 [href=this file] .
Using leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation to evaluate performance, we were able to decrease the number of transcripts to 5 at an optimal value of (penalty coefficient), while still observing a low misclassification error rate ( Supplementary Figure S6 [href=this file] ).
The transcripts listed in CellAge ( 23 [href=#B23] ) were largely (>90%) shared with the aggregate of all differentially expressed mRNAs in at least one cell type and a given senescence trigger ( Supplementary Tables S1–S9 [href=this file] ).",zip,Transcriptome signature of cellular senescence - PMC,HTML,"(36.4MB, zip)",media p,/articles/instance/6698740/bin/gkz555_supplemental_files.zip,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

Interestingly, GSK3β expression in AML differs little from normal hematopoiesis (Fig. S1b [this file] ). Consistent with GSK3α being overexpressed in AML, this analysis suggested that AML cell lines are significantly more sensitive (low RSA Sensitivity score) to GSK3α silencing as compared to GSK3β gene silencing (Fig. S1c [this file] ). Furthermore, AML cell lines constitute the most sensitive population of hematopoietic cell lines with regard to GSK3α gene silencing (Fig. S1d [this file] ). 
Our model had good accordance between predicted and experimental values (r = 0.71, AUC = 0.83) which is comparable to similar models (Figs 1a [rid=Fig1] , S2a [this file] ) . Interestingly, many of the gene features selected through regularization are known to associate with GSK3 signaling (STRING) , such as the TCF7 cofactor MLLT11, which had the most highly weighted coefficient (Fig. S2b [this file] ) . 
Interestingly, whereas tivantinib was only weakly correlated with paclitaxel, it was highly correlated with ML320 suggesting the GSK3 inhibition is the primary mechanism in which tivantinib elicits activity in these cells (Fig. S2c [this file] ). 
Pulldowns were of high quality with good reproducibility between biological replicates (Fig. S3a [this file] ). We prioritized targets with a SAINTScore ≥ 0.95, a CRAPomePCT ≥ 0.95 and an –ln(NSAF) ≥ −7 (Fig. S3b [this file] ). 
Detailed flow cytometry analysis showed a strong accumulation of cells in G2/M phase upon tivantinib treatment (Figs 3c [rid=Fig3] , S4 [this file] ). Similar increases in early apoptosis were observed over time between tivantinib and LiCl; however, a much larger late apoptotic population was observed with tivantinib treatment (Figs 3d [rid=Fig3] , S5 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, while tivantinib treatment for 96 hours resulted in a significant increase of cell differentiation, LiCl caused a much stronger effect (Figs 3e [rid=Fig3] , S6 [this file] ), which is consistent with previous studies . 
Using several different primary AML patient samples, tivantinib displayed a strong ability to inhibit colony formation at the clinically relevant concentration of 5 μM across all patients with only a few colonies remaining (Figs 5a [rid=Fig5] , S7 [this file] ). Single drug ABT-199 treatment showed slight variations in efficacy, but on average reduced colony formation to approximately 30–40 percent consistent with previous reports (Figs 5a [rid=Fig5] , S7 [this file] ) . The combination of tivantinib and ABT-199 exerted synergy in 4 of 7 patients with moderate (patients 1 and 2) to strong synergy (patients 3 and 4) values (Figure S7 [this file] ). Consistent with GSK3α being overexpressed across all major AML karyotypes (Figure S1a [this file] ), tivantinib efficacy did not show any obvious relationship with mutational status or karyotypes (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] ; Table S2 [rid=MOESM3] ) although the number of patient samples was low.",pdf,Off-target based drug repurposing opportunities for tivantinib in acute myeloid leukemia,XML,,,,,,,

A) The entire PyALBA4 ORF was deleted by introducing linear plasmid DNA containing two homology repair sequences flanking a GFP cassette and HsDHFR cassette. B) The successful disruption of the PyALBA4 ORF was confirmed by genotyping PCR, and two clonal parasite lines were isolated by limited dilution cloning. Primer sequences are provided in Supplemental Table 20.",SD1,,"Replacement of the PyALBA4 open reading frame with both a drug resistance cassette (HsDHFR) and GFP expression cassette (GFPmut2) enabled rapid selection and isolation by limited dilution cloning, which was confirmed by genotyping PCR ( Supp Figure 1 [href=this file] ). In contrast to previous reports of ALBA proteins (including PbALBA4), no significant growth defect was observed in asexual blood stage ( 37 [href=#R37] , 50 [href=#R50] ) when compared to a wild-type line with a GFPmut2 expression cassette integrated in the dispensable locus (WT-GFP) ( Supp Figure 2 [href=this file] ).
As rodent-infectious species produce gametocytes that are sexual dimorphic for much of their development, we assigned parasites into three categories as has been done for previously: sexual dimorphic (immature), mature males, and mature females (scoring key provided in Supp Figure 3 [href=this file] ) ( 51 [href=#R51] ).
While we observed no significant differences in the prevalence of mosquito infection, oocyst numbers, nor in the total number of sporozoites per infected mosquito (the sum of midgut and salivary gland sporozoites) ( Supp Table 2 [href=#SD2] , Supp Fig 4, Supp Fig 5 [href=this file] ), we observed a significant effect upon the semi-synchronous egress of sporozoites from oocysts in the midgut and their arrival in the salivary gland ( Fig 1B [href=#F1] ).
This genetic modification was confirmed by genotyping PCR ( Supp Fig 6 [href=this file] ), as well as by live fluorescence and immunofluorescence assays ( Fig 2 [href=#F2] , Supp Fig 7, Supp Fig 8 [href=this file] ).
In mosquito stages, PyALBA4 is first expressed diffusely throughout early oocysts (Day 3) but then much of it is directed to puncta within developing sporozoites ( Supp Fig 7 [href=this file] ), with the remainder persisting within sporoblasts/cytoplasmic islands. Finally, PyALBA4 follows a similar pattern in liver stage parasites, shifting from a largely diffuse expression pattern in mid-liver stage (24 hours) to increasingly smaller puncta during late (48 hours) and very late (52 hours) liver stage ( Supp Fig 8 [href=this file] , Supp Table 4 [href=#SD2] ).
This is further supported when these datasets are compared to transcripts found to associate with DOZI/CITH by RIP-chip, with 108 of 226 transcripts overlapping ( Supp Fig 9A [href=this file] , Supp Table 7 [href=#SD2] ) ( 23 [href=#R23] ).
These effects are consistent with changes observed when another ALBA family member, PfALBA1, was overexpressed in asexual blood stages and may reflect invasion-related roles for ALBA family proteins ( Supp Figure 9B [href=this file] ) ( 37 [href=#R37] ).
Immunoprecipitations were confirmed by western blotting prior to mass spectroscopic analyses ( Supp Figures 10 and 11 [href=this file] ), and the resulting mass spectra (nano LC/MS/MS) were analyzed using the Trans-Proteomic Pipeline (TPP, Institute for Systems Biology) to identify peptides and to infer protein identities with a stringent <1% false discovery rate (FDR).
Finally, we also note that ALBA4 undergoes proteolysis, which may be biologically relevant or an artifact of sample preparation despite how rapidly they can be processed ( Figure S11 [href=this file] ).
Smears were viewed under 100X oil objective and the numbers of mature female, mature male, and immature gametocytes were counted per ~10,000 red blood cells (see Supp Fig 3 [href=this file] for a key for these gametocyte populations).",pdf,ALBA4 modulates its stage-specific interactions and specific mRNA fates during Plasmodium growth and transmission - PMC,HTML,"(5.8MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/5688949/bin/NIHMS906627-supplement-Supp_Figs.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

While we observed no significant differences in the prevalence of mosquito infection, oocyst numbers, nor in the total number of sporozoites per infected mosquito (the sum of midgut and salivary gland sporozoites) ( Supp Table 2 [href=this file] , Supp Fig 4, Supp Fig 5 [href=#SD1] ), we observed a significant effect upon the semi-synchronous egress of sporozoites from oocysts in the midgut and their arrival in the salivary gland ( Fig 1B [href=#F1] ). Instead, parasites continue to egress from the oocysts over time and are capable of invading the salivary gland and are highly infectious to mice ( Supp Table 3 [href=this file] ).
Finally, PyALBA4 follows a similar pattern in liver stage parasites, shifting from a largely diffuse expression pattern in mid-liver stage (24 hours) to increasingly smaller puncta during late (48 hours) and very late (52 hours) liver stage ( Supp Fig 8 [href=#SD1] , Supp Table 4 [href=this file] ).
Those that remain with greater than a 2-fold change in abundance (36 increase, Supp Table 5 [href=this file] ; 190 decrease, Supp Table 6 [href=this file] ) include many transcripts that encode for functions important to the gametocyte (calcium-dependent activities; inner membrane complex proteins: GAPM2, MAP45, IMC1b-IMC1k, GAP50) or to early mosquito stage infections (LCCL-domain containing proteins: CCp1, CCp2, CCp4, LAP5; CPW-WPC protein family members; WARP; PSOP proteins 6, 13, and 20). This is further supported when these datasets are compared to transcripts found to associate with DOZI/CITH by RIP-chip, with 108 of 226 transcripts overlapping ( Supp Fig 9A [href=#SD1] , Supp Table 7 [href=this file] ) ( 23 [href=#R23] ).
Here, loss of contributes to a mixed effect but upon twice as many mRNAs (1131 transcripts with > 2-fold change in abundance), with some notable increases and decreases in transcript abundances compared to the WT-GFP control line that are distinct from other parasite stages ( Figure 3CD [href=#F3] , Supp Table 8 [href=this file] ). In sporozoites, two gene ontology (GO) terms were significantly attributed to transcripts that increased in abundance: RNA-binding proteins and translation factor activity ( Supp Table 9 [href=this file] ). Of those genes that experienced a decrease in transcript abundance in sporozoites were those associated with heat shock protein binding ( Supp Table 10 [href=this file] ).
In contrast to its roles in gametocyte and sporozoite stages, PyALBA4 exerts a pronounced effect in asexual blood stage schizonts to decrease the abundance of specific transcripts that are largely distinct from the transcripts affected in other stages ( Supp Table 11 [href=this file] , in parasites where ALBA4 is missing, only four transcripts decrease in abundance >2-fold while 251 increase in abundance >2-fold). Transcripts that were affected included those that encode functions related to microtubule motor activity and binding ( Supp Table 12 [href=this file] ), including several dynein heavy and light chain proteins, actin-related proteins, and kinesins.
This is also evident from how little overlap there is between the differentially affected transcripts in gametocytes, sporozoites, and asexual blood stage schizonts, with only six transcripts being affected across all three stages ( Figure 3D [href=#F3] , Supp Table 13 [href=this file] ).
First, using gametocytes enriched by sulfadiazine selection and Accudenz purification, we confirmed that PyALBA4 indeed associates with members of the DOZI and CITH complexes ( Table 1 [href=#T1] , complete list provided in Supp Table 14 [href=this file] ) ( 26 [href=#R26] ). Additionally, factors that associate with RNA and shuttle between the nucleus and cytosol were also identified, including RNA-binding proteins (Bruno/CELF2, CELF4 and Mushashi), stress granule components (GBP2), and splicing factors (SR1, PREBP) ( Supp Table 15 [href=this file] ) ( 36 [href=#R36] , 53 [href=#R53] , 54 [href=#R54] ).
Complete datasets for all three stages with both thresholds noted are provided ( Supp Table 14, Supp Table 16, and Supp Table 17 [href=this file] ).
Upon expanding this threshold (0.35), many additional members of the DOZI/CITH/ALBA complex from blood stages are then included, such as ALBA2, Bruno/CELF2, GBP2, Aldolase, UAP56, and ribosomal proteins from both small and large subunits ( Table 2 [href=#T2] , Supp Table 16 [href=this file] ).
Consistent with this, we observe substantial overlap in interactions between asexual blood stage schizonts and purified gametocytes, much of which is attributable to the DOZI/CITH/ALBA complex ( Figure 4 [href=#F4] , Supp Table 17 [href=this file] ). Comparison of the PyALBA4 and CK2-beta interactomes revealed significant overlap ( Supp Table 18 [href=this file] ), whereas those proteins from the PyALBA4 dataset that did not overlap largely have functions consistent with stress granule functions. Moreover, we also searched our proteomic data for clear evidence of phosphorylation of members of the PyALBA4 complex in schizonts and gametocytes, and detected modification of PyALBA4, ALBA3, Bruno/CELF2, GBP2, EF1g, and eIF3A even without enrichment of phosphorylated proteins ( Supp Table 19 [href=this file] ). This is further supported by the presence of other translation factors, including elongation factors (EF1a, EF1b, EF1g, EF2), eukaryotic initiation factors (eIF2g, eIF3D, eIF3E, eIF3G, eIF5a), and PABP-Interacting Protein 1 (PAIP1) which stimulates eIF3 subunits during active translation ( Table 2 [href=#T2] , Supp Table 17 [href=this file] ).
Taken together, these proteomic datasets indicate that many of these interacting partners are conserved across all three stages and likely form a core complex: Musashi, Bruno, GBP2, SR1, GAPDH, Aldolase, PABP, a thioredoxin peroxidase, EF1alpha, ribosomal proteins and ALBA1, 2, 3, and 4 ( Figure 4 [href=#F4] ; Supp Table 14, Supp Table 16, and Supp Table 17 [href=this file] ).

The minimal distance distribution between α-SMA-positive vessels and metastatic lesions was unimodal, whereas that between VEGFR3-positive vessels and metastatic lesions was bimodal (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). The density plots showed that 91% of the metastases localized within 100 μm from α-SMA-positive vessels (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). Although 43% of the metastases localized within 75 µm from VEGFR3-positive vessels, 53% of the metastases were within 75–400 µm of VEGFR3-positive vessels (Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] ).

A maximum concentration is reached 8 h after addition and it is maintained for at least 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). Comparing labelling (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] ) with parent -propargyl adenosine ( , Fig. 1f [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ) yielded a larger number of significantly enriched proteins with the pronucleotide. Immunoprecipitation of the two selected proteins PFKP and PPME1 from the probe treated HeLa cells followed by click reaction with rhodamine-azide tag confirmed incorporation of the probe into these proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). 
For both PARP inhibitors, no influence on labelling intensity was observed based on in-gel fluorescence analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). Second, only two of our identified AMPylated proteins in HeLa cells (HIST1H2AH, RPS10) matched known ADP-ribosylated proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ) . 
We were able to directly analyse AMPylated peptides on three different cysteine cathepsin proteases CTSB (S104 and S107), CTSC (S254) and CTSL (S137) in HeLa cells (Supplementary Figs. 4 [this file] and 5 [this file] ). To determine whether FICD is the AMPylator of these cathepsins, we used an in vitro peptidase activity assay and found that cathepsin B is indeed inhibited upon FICD (wild-type (wt) or E234A mutant) treatment and did not observe any inhibition without the addition of ATP (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Here, previous trials in cell lysates using an active recombinant FICD E234G mutant yielded a complementary set of proteins likely due to an increased degree of modification (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] and Supplementary Data 5 [rid=MOESM8] ) . 
Exemplary MS/MS spectrum (MaxQuant) for the CTSB AMPylation site identification on S107 (see Supplementary Figs. 4 [this file] and 5 [this file] ). 
We performed chemical-proteomic profiling in three different cancer cell lines, HeLa, A549 and SH-SY5Y, which revealed a total of 58 significantly enriched proteins, of which 38 were contributed solely from the latter neuroblastoma cells (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
To directly dissect the descent of AMPylated proteins from FICD, we compared the AMPylation levels of proteins in probe treated HeLa cells comprising FICD knockdown, wt FICD overexpression (OX) and activated FICD E234G OX (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] and Supplementary Data 6 [rid=MOESM9] ). Of note, FICD E234G revealed a more pronounced interaction with HSPA5, confirming our OX studies (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] and Supplementary Data 7 [this file0] ). 
Thus, normalisation of total AMPylation to the expression of HSPA5 results in an overall reduction of its AMPylation, which is in line with previously published results (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ) . Despite the moderate impact of ER stress on AMPylation in these cells, we found 145 dysregulated proteins in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
To study AMPylation in a model system of developing neurons, neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons were generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs, Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ) . Successively, iPSCs, NPCs and neurons were each treated with and the enriched proteins were analysed via LFQ LC-MS/MS (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] and 12 [this file] and Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM4] and 8 [this file1] ). This is of particular interest as the cytoskeletal remodelling, which is required for neuronal polarisation, migration, and proper axon guidance, is a highly dynamic processes precisely regulated by several PTMs on tubulin and microtubules - and AMPylation may indeed be an additional one (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] ) . AMPylation remodelling could be involved in the process of cell type specification and differentiation from iPSCs through NPCs to neurons, with cellular proteins undergoing substantial de- and re-AMPylation following an hourglass-like model (Fig. 4b [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ) . Further, parallel chemical-proteomics studies of AMPylation under ER stress induced by Tg in iPSCs, NPCs and neurons showed distinct responses ranging from a strong change of AMPylation of several proteins in iPSCs over mild alterations in NPCs to an obvious upregulation on two proteins (HSPA5 and SQSTM1) in neurons (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
To specify if the observed AMPylation in neurons is common for differentiated postmitotic cells we performed chemical profiling in fibroblasts (Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 14 [this file] ). 
The chemical-proteomic results were corroborated by fluorescence imaging of probe-treated HeLa, iPSCs, NPCs and neurons (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 15 [this file] and Supplementary Data 9 [this file2] ). Indeed, we observed only a slight decrease in overall cell staining by rather than disappearance of the bright AMPylation spots, while we observed a strong decrease in 5-EU labelling (Supplementary Fig. 16 [this file] ). 
In cerebral organoids, FICD (green) is enriched in the DCX+ neuronal layer (white), which is in line with qPCR data from 2D in vitro generated NPCs and neurons (Supplementary Fig. 19 [this file] ). See also Supplementary Fig. 15 [this file] . 
Given that the cellular localisation of FICD and AMPylated proteins might play an important functional role, we combined click chemistry with rhodamine-azide for intracellular probe visualisation with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for FICD and various cellular markers: PDI for rough endoplasmic reticulum, GM130 for Golgi complex, TUBB3 for total neuronal microtubule cytoskeleton, MAP2 for neuronal dendrites, phospho-TAU for neuronal axons, and DAPI to visualise nuclei (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 15 [this file] ). This observation was further corroborated by overexpression of FICD with a C-terminal FLAG tag (Supplementary Figure 17 [this file] ) and by analysis of the FICD’s glycosylation using endoglycosidase H assay (Supplementary Fig. 17 [this file] ). Finally, fibroblasts showed another specific localisation pattern with AMPylation accumulated around the nucleus and its’ complete absence inside (Supplementary Figure 15 [this file] ). 
COs contain areas which closely resemble the structure and organisation of the germinal zones of developing human neocortex (Supplementary Figure 18 [this file] ) . Treatment of COs with and subsequent analysis via LFQ LC-MS/MS confirmed the AMPylation of PFKP, found in all cell types, and CTSB, another prevalent target in other studied cell lines (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Figs. 5 [this file] and 12 [this file] ). Analysis of the significantly enriched proteins using a STRING database revealed that several proteins are located in extracellular space (Supplementary Fig. 13 [this file] ). Interestingly, visualisation of the probe-treated COs via click-chemistry with rhodamine-azide revealed strongest fluorescence in the neuronal layer (Fig. 5i, j [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 15 [this file] ), which is in line with the highest number of AMPylated proteins identified in neurons (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] ). 
To examine the function of AMPylation in neurogenesis and neuronal differentiation in more detail, we first characterised the expression of FICD in NPCs, neurons, neuroblastoma cells and COs and found a clear enrichment of FICD in the neurites of neurons, SH-SY5Y and in the neuronal layer of COs compared to the progenitor zone (Fig. 5d, h [rid=Fig5] ; Supplementary Fig. 15 [this file] ). Results of imaging were paralleled by qPCR studies demonstrating higher baseline expression levels of FICD in neurons compared to iPSCs and NPCs (Supplementary Fig. 19 [this file] ). We knocked down FICD levels (Supplementary Fig. 20 [this file] ) in NPCs differentiating to neurons (Fig. 6a, b [rid=Fig6] ) and found a significant increase in transfected cells that remain in cell cycle (KI67+) (Fig. 6a [rid=Fig6] ). To asses if FICD-mediated activity has a function in neurogenesis during development, COs were analysed 7 (Figs. 6 [rid=Fig6] and 7 [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] ) and 14 days post-electroporation (dpe) (Supplementary Fig. 22 [this file] ). Cortical-like germinal zones were defined by immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis using PAX6 as a marker for dorsal aRGs (Figs. 6d [rid=Fig6] , and 7b [rid=Fig7] ) with mitotic cells labelled for PH3 (Fig. 6e [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] ). The position and number of neurons was analysed by IHC using two different markers for mature neurons: MAP2, a microtubule-associated protein which is enriched in neuronal dendrites (Fig. 7c [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] ) and the nuclear marker NEUN (Figs. 6g [rid=Fig6] and 7d [rid=Fig7] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] for analysis of PH3+ progenitors upon FICD wt/E234G/H363A OX in COs and for scoring of MAP2+ progenitor cells intruding the VZ upon FICD KD or FICD wt/E234G/H363A OX in COs and Supplementary Fig. 22 [this file] for the analysis of 2 weeks after electroporation of COs with FICD wt/E234G OX constructs. 
Conversely, when electroporating vectors carrying wt FICD, activated FICD E234G mutant or catalytically inactive FICD H363A mutant into ventricles of 50 days old COs, those transfected with FICD wt or E234G showed an increase and redistribution in fluorescent signal upon treatment indicating a remodelling of AMPylation upon FICD overexpression (Fig. 7a [rid=Fig7] ), while there were no changes in distribution or intensity of the signal upon OX of FICD H363A used as a control (Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] and similarly in neuroblastoma cells Supplementary Fig. 23 [this file] ). At the same time, MAP2+ neurites increasingly invaded these progenitor zones 7 dpe (Fig. 7c [rid=Fig7] , blue arrowheads; Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] ) and 14 dpe (Supplementary Fig. 22 [this file] ), which was not the case upon control or FICD H363A electroporation (Fig. 7c [rid=Fig7] ), nor upon FICD KD (Supplementary Fig. 21 [this file] ). Interestingly, both the E234G mutant and wt FICD-transfected aRGs gave rise to a significantly higher number of neurons compared to H363A inactive mutant or control already at 7 dpe (Fig. 7e, f [rid=Fig7] ), which was consistent also at 14 dpe (Supplementary Fig. 22 [this file] ). Additionally, we have excluded other cellular processes to be involved in the observed effect by whole proteome analysis of FICD transfected neuroblastoma cells (Supplementary Fig. 24 [this file] , Supplementary Data 10 [this file3] ), which showed only minimal changes in overall protein expression. Furthermore, pull-down of the AMPylated proteins from neuroblastoma cells under FICD E234G OX conditions revealed a general increase in AMPylation including proteins such as CTSB, TPP1, CAPZB, and NSFL1C, which were found AMPylated in COs (Supplementary Fig. 25 [this file] , Supplementary Data 11 [this file4] ).

The resulting miRNA expression plasmids were sequenced, the knockdown efficiency was validated in Hela cells via qPCR and Westernblot and the most efficient construct was used for NPC transfection and for electroporation of COs (Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Fig. 19 [this file] ).

Figures  S1–S9  and  Tables  S1  and  S2,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"In addition, 21.9% (7 of 32) of patients from the CHIK-deaths group developed neurologic signs and symptoms (e.g., confusion, syncope, adynamia, and sensory loss) ( Figures S1 [this file] A and S1B). The CHIK-deaths group was composed predominantly of males (male-to-female ratio = 1.46), and the median age was 52 years (interquartile, 36–73 years old), but no significant difference regarding age and sex were observed among the three groups ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] C and S1 [this file] C). The comorbidity most often reported in the CHIKV-deaths group was hypertension (21.9%, 7 of 32) ( Figure S1 [this file] D). 
CHIKV RNA was detected in CSF samples from all fatal cases ( Figure S1 [this file] E). CHIKV RNA was also detected in the spleen (52%, 13 of 25), lung (44%, 11 of 25), liver (28%, 7 of 25), kidney (20%, 5 of 25), heart (20%, 5 of 25), and brain (13%, 3 of 23) of CHIK-death patients from available specimens ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] F and S1 [this file] E). Moreover, histopathological findings of CHIK-death cases revealed extensive damage in the brain (e.g., anoxic depolarization, perivascular mononuclear infiltration, necrosis, and hemorrhage), and hemodynamic abnormalities (e.g., vascular congestion and edema) in the brain, lung, spleen, and kidney ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] G and S2 [this file] ). 
Moreover, IFN-λ3 (IL-28B) was 1.4-fold higher in the CHIK-deaths group compared with the CHIK-survivors group (p = 0.0005) ( Figure 3 [rid=fig3] A; Table S1 [this file] ). 
Based on an analysis of 82 metabolites, we found 56 that were differentially expressed in the sera of the CHIK-deaths group compared with patients who survived CHIK ( Figures S3 [this file] and S4 [this file] ). 
We identified and quantified 580 proteins ( Figure S5 [this file] ), including 338 proteins (188 downregulated and 150 upregulated) that were differentially expressed in the CHIK-deaths group compared with the healthy group. Also, we found 525 proteins (268 downregulated and 257 upregulated) differentially expressed in the CHIK-survivors group compared with the healthy group ( Figure S5 [this file] ). 
To better understand the impact of CHIKV on specific biological processes, we conducted a pathway enrichment analysis using significantly dysregulated proteins and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Reactome databases. [xref] [rid=bib29] [xref] [rid=bib30] We found that enriched pathways associated with CHIK-deaths and CHIK-survivor groups but not with the healthy group were related to hemostasis (i.e., platelet degranulation, complement and coagulation cascades, common pathway of fibrin clot formation, clotting cascade, platelet activation and aggregation, binding and uptake of ligands by scavenger receptors, and metabolism), and the immune system (innate immune system, neutrophil degranulation, biosynthesis of amino acids, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and post-translational protein phosphorylation) ( Figures S6 [this file] and S7 [this file] ). 
To contextualize our data, we also included 10 novel CHIKV genome sequences obtained from patients in São Paulo, Maranhão, and Alagoas States in Brazil ( Table S2 [this file] ). 
Because of this, we conducted molecular dynamic simulations of CHIKV with the matrix remodeling associated 8 (MXRA8), a receptor for multiple arthritogenic alphaviruses, including CHIKV. [xref] [rid=bib31] [xref] [rid=bib32] [xref] [rid=bib33] We observed that the CHIKV-ECSA lineage with H242 resulted in reduced E2 surface area and increased the buried surface area interacting with the human MXRA8 receptor, compared with the ancestral E2-R242, due to physical proximity of the E3 protein toward the D2 domain of the MXRA8 receptor ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] D, 5E, and S8 [this file] ). Also, the CHIKV-H242 variant resulted in lower root mean square fluctuation compared with CHIKV-R242 in the contact region of E2 protein with MXRA8 ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] F and S8 [this file] ). Alanine-scanning mutagenesis analysis also indicates that E2-H242 may be relevant to the MXRA8 interaction with CHIKV glycoprotein based on free-energy differences compared with CHIKV strains harboring R242 ( Figure S9 [this file] ). 
The lengths of the simulations were sufficient to ensure stabilization of the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) for both native and R242H mutants ( Figures S8 [this file] and S9 [this file] ).",pdf,Pathophysiology of chikungunya virus infection associated with fatal outcomes,XML,,,,,,,

We further analyzed the proteins prepared by the SP3 method with the three different bead amounts using SDS-PAGE, Figure S1 [href=this file] in Supporting Information I [href=this file] . We also noted that the SP3 method-based sample cleanup introduced an obvious bias against large proteins (higher than 50 kDa) compared to the sample before cleanup, Figure S1 [href=this file] . The bias was also observed in the HepG2 human cell lysate processed by the SP3 method, Figure S2 [href=this file] .
We obtained a higher protein recovery for the human cell lysate than the cell lysate (86% vs 60%) using the MU method, presumably due to the fact that proteins tend to be smaller than human proteins in the length range of 1–250 amino acids based on the data in Swiss-Prot database, Figure S3 [href=this file] , resulting in a higher chance for protein to flow through the membrane (30 kDa MWCO) for the sample.
The whole workflow shows good reproducibility regarding the CZE separation profile, base peak intensity ( Table S1 [href=this file] ), and identifications.
We also identified one proteoform of 60S ribosomal protein L32 with one disulfide bond, Figure S4 [href=this file] , which is not reported in the literature according to the UniProt Knowledgebase.

In two independent experiments, the most abundant peptide hit for tagged GPR35 mapped to Na/K-ATPase subunit α (Uniprot P05023 [href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/P05023] isoform 4; encoded by ), and was not present in HEK293T cells transfected with tag only, or in mock-transfected cells ( table S1 [href=this file] ).
Indeed a 75% knock-down ( fig S2a [href=this file] ) of mRNA expression by siRNA in Caco2 cells resulted in a 15% reduction in Rb uptake compared to cells transfected with control siRNA ( Fig. 2B [href=#F2] ).
The increase in resting Ca to maximum levels appeared to be specific for deletion, because siRNA-mediated knock-down ( fig S2b [href=this file] ) of mRNAs encoding other, unrelated GPCRs such as (which encodes the β -adrenoreceptor), cannabinoid receptor 2 ( ), and LPA receptor 2 ( ) in BMDMs did not affect, or minimally lowered resting intracellular Ca ( Fig. 2F [href=#F2] ).
S3 [href=this file] ) as expected ( 47 [href=#R47] ).
We therefore designed a series of palmitoylated peptides that targeted the i1, i2, or i3 loop and initially screened them in wild-type compared to BMDMs for their effect on Ca and chemotactic responses ( fig S4, A and B [href=this file] ). g35-i2 and g35-i3, which target the i2 and i3 loop, respectively, were characterized further ( Fig. 7A [href=#F7] ). g35-i2 triggered a transient increase in IP in wild-type BMDMs, which was absent in BMDMs ( Fig. 7B [href=#F7] ).

A-ZFP and A-Delta were expressed in ~80% of striatal astrocytes, but in negligible neurons ( Figure S2A [href=this file] – C [href=this file] ). tdTomato was also expressed in 80% of astrocytes and was not found in neurons ( Figure S2A [href=this file] – C [href=this file] ).
N-Delta and N-ZFP were expressed in ~98% of neurons, but negligibly in astrocytes ( Figure S2D [href=this file] – F [href=this file] ). Furthermore, tdTomato was expressed in ~82% of neurons and was not found in astrocytes ( Figure S2D [href=this file] – F [href=this file] ). The degree of mHTT lowering in neurons and astrocytes was similar when assessed with IHC whether ZFP and Delta-ZFP expression was assessed by virtue of the HA tag or by expression of the tdTomato ( Figure 1E [href=#F1] , H [href=#F1] ; Figure S3 [href=this file] ).
Astrocyte-specific RNA-seq data were enriched with 200 striatal astrocyte enriched genes , whereas neuronal RNA-seq data were enriched with 200 MSN genes ( Figure S4A [href=this file] , B [href=this file] ).
We found little evidence for uniquely A1 astrocytes in HD and no evidence of A-ZFP or N-ZFP affecting A1 marker genes in R6/2 mice ( Figure S4C [href=this file] ). We did find evidence of A-ZFP and N-ZFP reversing changes of astrocyte DEGs identified previously in mouse models and post mortem human tissue ( Figure S4D [href=this file] ), although at this stage the relationship of those genes to pathogenesis is unknown. We found significant rescue of HD DEGs in comparisons for R6/2 and human snRNA-seq data; effects of neuronal mHTT lowering were much greater than astrocytic mHTT lowering ( Figure S5A [href=this file] – L [href=this file] ).
Consistent with Figure 3C [href=#F3] , we found that disruption of cholesterol metabolism was a core feature of astrocytes in mouse models and in human data when DEGs were assessed with RNA-seq ( Figure S6 [href=this file] ). However, the agreement was weaker in relation to studies in zQ175 mice and for astrocytes derived from human embryonic stem cells that used fluorescence activated cell sorting and microarrays ( Figure S6 [href=this file] ).
We assessed 46 genes known to carry CAG repeats or to be downstream of genes that carry CAG repeats in our A-ZFP and N-ZFP data for astrocytic and neuronal RNA-seq ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ). Most were not detected with criteria for astrocyte and neuron enrichment ( Figure 2D(ii) [href=#F2] ), but of those that were, we found suppression of , , and only in neurons following N-ZFP, and suppression of in astrocytes following N-ZFP or A-ZFP ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ). This was expected as , , and are comparatively depleted in astrocytes relative to input, whereas is neither depleted nor enriched in astrocytes relative to the IP fraction ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ). Overall, the analyses of cell type markers ( Figure 1D [href=#F1] , F [href=#F1] , Figures S1 [href=this file] – 3 [href=this file] ), MDS ( Figure 2C [href=#F2] ), and known off target genes repressed by ZFPs ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ) suggests that our approach and analyses detected mainly astrocyte and neuronal gene expression and their alterations following ZFPs.
We found that N-ZFP significantly, but subtly, improved excitability as measured by input-output curves ( Figure S8A [href=this file] , B [href=this file] ). N-ZFP also significantly restored the resting membrane potential, cell capacitance, membrane resistance, and Rheobase ( Figure S8A [href=this file] – F [href=this file] ). Furthermore, N-ZFP rescued the loss of spontaneous excitatory post synaptic currents (sEPSCs) associated with HD in R6/2 mice, with no effect on sEPSC amplitude ( Figure S8G [href=this file] – I [href=this file] ). In contrast, astrocytic ZFPs did not improve these MSN electrophysiological properties ( Figures S8J [href=this file] – R [href=this file] ).
AAVs containing N-ZFP or N-Delta were microinjected intrastriatally at 6 months of age and neuron-specific and bulk RNA-seq was performed at 12 months ( Figure S9A [href=this file] ). The N-ZFPs reduced mHTT levels in Darpp32 positive neurons at 12 months by ~55% ( Figure S10A [href=this file] , B [href=this file] ). Our evaluations in 12 month old zQ175 mice showed that N-ZFPs were effective at reducing HD-associated DEGs and pathways in neuronal RNA-seq data ( Figure S9B [href=this file] , C [href=this file] , S9H [href=this file] – J [href=this file] ), that known astrocytic DEGs from zQ175 mice were also significantly rescued by N-ZFPs within bulk RNA-seq ( Figure S9D [href=this file] – G [href=this file] ), and that HD-associated changes in glia identified in human data and overlapping with zQ175 bulk RNA-seq data were also partially rescued ( Figure S10C [href=this file] – L [href=this file] ).
We packaged A-ZFP and N-ZFP into BBB-penetrant PHP.eBs to deliver them or the Delta controls throughout the brain ( Figure 4A [href=#F4] – C [href=#F4] ) of R6/2 and NCAR mice positive for the Ly6a receptor gene required for these AAVs to cross the BBB ( Figure S11A [href=this file] ). HA-tagged A-Delta, N-Delta, A-ZFP, and N-ZFPs were detected throughout the brain and their expression studied relative to mHTT ( Figure 4D [href=#F4] – G [href=#F4] ; Figure S11B [href=this file] – I [href=this file] ). mHTT aggregate intensity for brain areas such as the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus suggested that A-ZFP and N-ZFP lowered mHTT levels relative to the Delta controls ( Figure S11B [href=this file] – I [href=this file] ), allowing detailed astrocyte and neuron specific evaluations for the striatum ( Figure 4H [href=#F4] – K [href=#F4] ).
We summarized the behavioral data for each evaluation for A-ZFP and N-ZFP ( Figure S12A [href=this file] , B [href=this file] ) and found that A-ZFP produced modest 26% improvement of the overall aggregate z-score, but that N-ZFP improved HD mouse behavioral phenotypes by ~89% ( Figure 5 [href=#F5] , Figure S12A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] ). However, relative to the Delta group, R6/2 mice receiving N-ZFPs gained less weight as they aged ( Figure S12C [href=this file] – F [href=this file] ).
We detected ~2800 proteins in each case for the Delta groups, A-ZFP, and N-ZFP ( Figure S13A [href=this file] – B [href=this file] ). A greater effect of N-ZFP on HD-associated DEPs was also observed when the Delta groups were combined between astrocytic and neuronal studies ( Figure S13G [href=this file] ). The top 50 up- and down-regulated DEPs rescued by A-ZFP or N-ZFP are shown in Figure 6G [href=#F6] – J [href=#F6] ; the top IPA pathways for the HD DEPs are shown in Figure S13C [href=this file] – F [href=this file] .
The finding that early interventions were more effective than later N-ZFP administration ( Figure 7A [href=#F7] , B [href=#F7] ) most likely reflects greater mHTT lowering by early N-ZFP (~80%; Figure 4K [href=#F4] ) later N-ZFP administration (~20%; Figure S14A [href=this file] – C [href=this file] ). mHTT aggregates are already formed by 7 weeks of age in R6/2 mice, implying that ZFP-mediated mHTT lowering is most effective before aggregate formation.
Incidentally, cell loss does not occur in the R6/2 model and consistent with this, we found no evidence that either A-ZFP or N-ZFP increased the numbers of astrocytes or neurons relative to controls, respectively in R6/2 mice ( Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ).",docx,Neuronal and astrocytic contributions to Huntington’s disease dissected with zinc finger protein transcriptional repressors - PMC,HTML,"(7.3MB, docx)",media p,/articles/instance/9898160/bin/NIHMS1859868-supplement-Supplementary_information.docx,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

Principal-component and differential expression analyses confirmed that each population had unique enrichment signatures ( Figures 3B [rid=F3] and S2A [this file] ). The transitional ( / double-positive) domain was enriched for Notch target genes known to function in somite segmentation, such as , , and ( Figures 3C, 3D [rid=F3] , and S2B [this file] ), and also expressed low levels of . 
In contrast, during notochord segmentation, expression was clearly detected in newly formed and mature segments at similar levels ( Figure S3 [this file] ), suggesting that its expression does not oscillate in the notochord, as it does during PSM segmentation. 
This experimental approach also allowed us to avoid somitogenesis defects ( Figures S4A and S4B [this file] ). Expression of GFP, or the system components QF2 or QUAS alone, did not lead to defects in either notochord or vertebral segmentation ( Figures 5A [rid=F5] and S4C [this file] ). At later stages, these early defects resolved into wedge, short, and pebble vertebrae, as visualized by staining with alizarin red ( Figures 5B [rid=F5] and S5A [this file] ). This manipulation generated gaps in the domain that were filled later by more but smaller and fused segments at the posterior end of the notochord and spine ( Figures 5C [rid=F5] and S5B [this file] ). 
To bypass the early developmental defects, we injected QS ( Potter et al., 2010 [rid=R37] ) mRNA at the one-cell stage to inhibit QF2 during early development ( Figure S6 [this file] ). On average, centra were longer and their number was decreased in fish expressing compared with controls ( Figures S5B and S5C [this file] ). 
Second, expression does not seem to oscillate in the notochord, as it does in the PSM ( Figure S3 [this file] ). 
Our data also suggest that notochord and spine segment size and number are linked (e.g., misexpression of produces less segments that are also larger; Figures S5B and S5C [this file] ).

Finally, a separate analysis of the interactomes of WT NSD1 and the NUP98 N-terminus uncovered that SMARCA5 was the only protein among the 20 most enriched interactors, to be bound independently by WT-NSD1 and N-terminal NUP98, which suggests a deeply rooted molecular connection with the fusion protein (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] & Tables 2 [this file] and 3 [this file] ). 
We achieved almost equilibrated expression and immunoprecipitation of the mutated constructs (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] D, Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). Strikingly, principal component analysis (PCA) separated the interactomes acquired for the FG-repeat motif deleted fusions and control on the one side, and full-length and PHD1-4 and PHD5-C5HCH deleted fusions on the other side, suggesting a prominent role of the disordered domains in the interactome organization (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] B-D, Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). To assess the impact of the mutated domains on the core interactome, we analyzed the LFQ values of the top 20 NUP98-NSD1 interactors and observed significant perturbations in this core interactome upon deletions of single or both FG repeat domains, whereas deletions of the PHD domains barely affected these interactions (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] C, Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] , Supplementary Tables 4-6 [this file] ). As expected, the interaction with RAE1, mediated by the GLEBS domain of NUP98 moiety, was not affected by FG repeat deletions (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] C, Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] B), indicating that our analysis identified specific, FG-repeat mediated interactions. 
Importantly, the fusion protein kept the nuclear puncta localization pattern, which was dependent on the presence of FG repeats (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). After expansion under antibiotic selection and enrichment by GFP sorting (Supplementary Fig. 5 A [this file] ), we confirmed the presence of NUP98-NSD1 nuclear puncta by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] A). Giemsa-Wright staining revealed a blast-like morphology of NUP98-NSD1/FLT3-ITD cells (Supplementary Fig. 5 B [this file] ). 
To further examine SMARCA5 function in transformed cells, we performed treatment with an allosteric inhibitor (ED2-AD101) targeting the ATPase activity of the ISWI family of chromatin remodelers (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ) [ 25 [rid=CR25] , 26 [rid=CR26] ], which consistently prevented colony formation in methylcellulose (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). To further address the clinical relevance of ED2-AD101, we treated NUP98-NSD1 patient cells using 10 μM concentration (following the previously calculated IC in transformed murine hematopoietic cells, Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ) and found some increase in expression of the CD11b and CD14 surface markers of myeloid differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] A). However, due to high cell death (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] B) upon inhibitor treatment we could not characterize the exact effect of the inhibitor, probably caused by the low specificity of the compound.",pdf,SMARCA5 interacts with NUP98-NSD1 oncofusion protein and sustains hematopoietic cells transformation,XML,,,,,,,

Moreover, we observed that cGAS, STING, IFIT1, and IRF7 protein expression were elevated following deletion (Figure 5B,C [rid=advs3449-fig-0005] ), and that depletion of cGAS suppressed the production of type I interferons (Figure 5B–D [rid=advs3449-fig-0005] and Figure S4A [this file] , Supporting Information).

Nevertheless, all three reacted to acid and alkali in the same way as wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ) so we did not proceed with additional analyses. 
Notably, the PDEB1 null mutant differs from both early procyclic forms, which react to acid and alkali, and late procyclic forms, which form projections in response to alkali but do not respond to acid (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Total numbers are derived from two replicates per cell line (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
We were able to obtain knockouts of CARP3 and 4, however (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). CARP4 null mutants did not show any difference to the parental line when they were subjected to a standard SoMo assay (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ) and were not analysed further. Deletion of CARP3, while not affecting growth in liquid culture (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ) or on plates (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] , d [this file] ), or expression of the early marker GPEET (Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ) resulted in a major SoMo defect (Fig. 6b [rid=Fig6] , upper panel) reminiscent of the PDEB1 null mutant. The CARP3 knockout did not display a motility defect in liquid culture (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b [this file] ) and still reacted to alkali, but did not react to acid on plates (Fig. 6b [rid=Fig6] , lower panel and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
In addition, we engineered an addback ectopically expressing an untagged version of CARP3 (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). In addition, whereas 55–60% of flies heavily infected with the wild type, and 100% heavily infected with the addback, had trypanosomes in the proventriculus, the knockout gave no heavy midgut infections nor did it colonise the proventriculus (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
CARP3 is present in both the cytoplasm and the flagellum (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ; www.tryptag.org (http://www.tryptag.org) ). We obtained null mutants of ACP2 and ACP6, but it was only possible to generate single knockouts of ACP1 and ACP5 (Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] , 7a [this file] ) implying that they are essential at this stage of the life cycle. The full knockout of ACP6 and the semi-knockout of ACP1 both exhibited hyper-SoMo phenotypes, while the full knockout of ACP2 showed no phenotype (Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). In terms of their pH response, ACP5 single knockouts resembled CARP3 double knockouts - they were able to form projections migrating towards an alkaline source, but were refractory to acid (Fig. 6e [rid=Fig6] , lower panel and Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). Further experiments showed that >80% of these cells were GPEET-positive and that the phenotype of the ACP5 mutants was not due to defects in growth or motility (Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] – g [this file] ). 
Down-regulation or deletion of ACP6 ( and Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ) or deletion of one copy of ACP1 cause hyper-SoMo, while ACP2 is not required for SoMo or pH taxis.",pdf,Cyclic AMP signalling and glucose metabolism mediate pH taxis by African trypanosomes,XML,,,,,,,

This revealed that the acral model developed a significantly higher proportion of fin tumours than the cutaneous model (53% versus 30%, < 0.0001) ( Fig. 1e [href=#F1] , Extended Data Fig. 2h [href=#F7] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ).
Whereas in the mosaic acral fish 53% of tumours (110 out of 206) arose on the fins, 84.2% (96 out of 114) of tumours from the acral stable line were fin tumours ( Extended Data Fig. 4c [href=#F9] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ). By contrast, only 39.7% (77 out of 194) of tumours arose on the fins in the cutaneous stable line ( Extended Data Fig. 4c [href=#F9] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ).
To determine which of the acral driver genes were sufficient for fin positioning, we expressed each one individually ( Fig. 2a [href=#F2] ). was the only genetic driver sufficient to form tumours without any additional genetic alterations ( Fig. 2b [href=#F2] , c [href=#F2] ), with 62% -alone tumours occurring in the fins ( Fig. 2d [href=#F2] , e [href=#F2] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ), indicating that fin melanocytes were more efficiently transformed by CRKL compared with other locations. Withdrawal of , or loss from the acral model still demonstrated fin specificity ( Fig. 2h [href=#F2] , i [href=#F2] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ). Whereas 62% (37 out of 60) of tumours arose on the fins in the mosaic fish, we found that 75.8% (25 out of 33) of tumours from -only stable transgenic fish were fin tumours ( Extended Data Fig. 4b [href=#F9] , c [href=#F9] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ).

Fish and tumour numbers are shown in Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] .
This modestly slowed tumour initiation ( Extended Data Fig. 10e [href=#F15] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ) and notably led to a robust loss of fin specificity in the acral melanoma model ( Fig. 5k [href=#F5] , l [href=#F5] , Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ).

A Venn diagram comparing differential interacting partners of KBTBD4 , KBTBD4 and KBTBD4 identified in LC-MS/MS is presented in Supplementary Fig. S2A [this file] . 
Interaction of exogenously expressed CoREST was also observed with KBTBD4 and KBTBD4 but not KBTBD4 after immunoprecipitation of CoREST (Supplementary Fig. S2B [this file] ). 
We also observed that CoREST ubiquitylation was prevented by MLN4924 (Supplementary Fig. S2C [this file] ) as predicted from the results of immunoprecipitation analysis (Fig. 1D [rid=Fig1] ). 
In DAOY medulloblastoma cell lines, we could detect interaction of endogenous CoREST with KBTBD4 , but not with KBTBD4 as in HEK293T (Supplementary Fig. S3A [this file] ). Expression of mutant KBTBD4 or KBTBD4 , but not KBTBD4 , promoted a drastic reduction in CoREST levels, which could be restored by treating cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Supplementary Fig. S3B [this file] ), showing that CoREST is targeted for proteasomal degradation by KBTBD4 mutants, but not KBTBD4 , in accordance with the interaction data. MLN4924 similarly prevented the degradation of CoREST in DAOY cell lines expressing KBTBD4 or KBTBD4 , demonstrating a role for CRL activity in controlling the levels of CoREST (Supplementary Fig. S3C [this file] ). 
All lines showed detectable CoREST and LSD1 proteins (Supplementary Fig. S3D [this file] ). Cells expressing mutant KBTBD4 showed a reduction in CoREST protein level, whereas these levels were unchanged by expression of KBTBD4 (Supplementary Fig. S3E [this file] ), consistent with data from other medulloblastoma cell lines. 
Minimal induction of KBTBD4 with the lowest doxycycline dose still promoted CoREST degradation (Supplementary Fig. S3F [this file] ). By contrast, the highest expression of KBTBD4 did not alter CoREST levels (Supplementary Fig. S3F [this file] ). In addition to CoREST, LSD1 was also degraded, although at a seemingly reduced level compared to CoREST (Supplementary Fig. S3F [this file] ). 
The increase in the epigenetic mark H3K4me2 was also confirmed by Western blotting in D283Med and DAOY cell lines (Supplementary Fig. S3G, H [this file] ). 
To identify the transcriptional programmes promoted by mutant KBTBD4, we compared total RNA-seq samples in quadruplicates from D283Med cells where expression of KBTBD4 , KBTBD4 or KBTBD4 was promoted by doxycycline untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S4A, B [this file] ). Although we detected a significant induction of KBTBD4 , a volcano plot and heatmap of differentially expressed genes revealed that KBTBD4 did not promote significant transcriptional changes (Fig. 3A [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. S4B [this file] ). 
To confirm that the transcriptional alterations detected are consistent in different models we also used the D425Med cell line, where expression of KBTBD4 or KBTBD4 faithfully leads to CoREST degradation (Supplementary Fig. S2E [this file] ). Using quantitative PCR (qPCR) in cells expressing KBTBD4 or KBTBD4 we could detect the upregulation of multiple CoREST targets (Supplementary Fig. S4C [this file] ), confirming the role of mutant KBTBD4 in different model cell lines. 
Interestingly, the changes observed in gene expression after induction of KBTBD4 mutants could be in part recapitulated by siRNA mediated depletion of CoREST, reinforcing the idea that KBTBD4 mutants are mainly acting through CoREST depletion (Supplementary Fig. S3D [this file] ). 
Surprisingly, we did not detect a significant difference in the proliferation of cells (Supplementary Fig. S5A [this file] ), indicating that other features enable KBTBD4 mutants to promote tumorigenesis. In addition, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) showed that epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), a fundamental pathway for vertebrate embryonic development and often linked to cell migration and metastatic potential of cancer cells [ 21 [rid=CR21] ], was significantly enriched in cell lines expressing either KBTBD4 mutant (Supplementary Fig. S5B [this file] ). In adherent medulloblastoma cells, we also could detect an increased migration of cells expressing KBTBD4 (Supplementary Fig. S5C [this file] ), supporting our GSEA analysis. 
Note that the increased tumorsphere formation can’t be ascribed to increased cell proliferation as this remains unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S5A [this file] ). 
In a second assay to measure stemness, we observed that KBTBD4 and KBTBD4 expression more than doubled the percentage of D283Med cells presenting with high ALDH activity compared to cells expressing KBTBD4 (Supplementary Fig. S5D [this file] ). More importantly, chemical inhibition of LSD1 (LSD1i) was found to mimic this phenotype and the combination of KBTBD4 mutant plus LSD1i did not show an additive effect (Fig. 4D [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. S5C [this file] ), showing that the increased stemness caused by KBTBD4 and KBTBD4 is exerted via modulation of CoREST complex activity. 
While GFI1 and GFI1B overexpressing tumours show high LSD1 activity that could be blocked using specific chemical inhibitors [ 30 [rid=CR30] ], our findings show that inhibition of LSD1 increases stemness (Fig. 4D [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. S5D [this file] ), raising caution over the use of LSD1 inhibitors in the treatment of specific subtypes of medulloblastoma. Our data also indicate that KBTBD4 mutation leads cells into an intermediate state of differentiation, keeping ES-like and EMT gene signatures (Fig. 4A, B [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. S5A [this file] ) while expressing differentiated features of several synaptic pathways (Fig. 3D, E [rid=Fig3] ).",pdf,Disease-associated KBTBD4 mutations in medulloblastoma elicit neomorphic ubiquitylation activity to promote CoREST degradation,XML,,,,,,,

We isolated homozygous T-DNA insertion lines for from publicly available collections (GABI-KAT, SALK and SAIL) and confirmed T-DNA inserts and full-length mRNA knockout (Supplementary Fig. 2A, B [this file] ). 
For full sequence alignments see Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] . , Representative rosette images of 4-week-old col-0, mutants, and two independent complementation lines ( and ) grown under long day (LD) conditions. 
Two independent transgenic lines expressing the full-length NOT4A protein (N4A-G1 and N4A-G3, Supplementary Fig. 2C [this file] ), displayed wild-type greenness and normal development (Fig. 1c–e [rid=Fig1] ), and NOT4A expression, determined by GUS staining, was localized to the first true leaves of seedlings where the pale mutant phenotype first presents (Fig. 1g [rid=Fig1] ). 
This revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the mutant relative to WT (>2300 genes, < 0.05), with GO-analysis showing that a large proportion of these are chloroplast-related and implicated across all structures of this organelle (Fig. 2a, b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] and Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM4] ). Carbon assimilation in stroma is undertaken by an array of higher order enzymatic complexes present within the internal membrane system of chloroplasts (thylakoids), which includes many nuclear-encoded components that were mis-regulated in the transcriptome (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ) . This revealed in a severe decrease in the accumulation of protein bands corresponding to the photosystem II monomer and cytochrome b f complex (PSII m/ Cyt b f), as well as the photosystem I - NAD(P)H dehydrogenase megacomplex (PSI-NDH), when equal protein was loaded (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 4A [this file] ). Individual subunits were then resolved by a second denaturing dimension, which confirmed lower abundance of the PetA, -B, -C and -D cytochrome b f complex subunits (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 4B [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 4A [this file] . 
Analysis of the chloroplast-specific proteins in these datasets (619 in WT, 689 in Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] ) confirmed reduced levels of all detected subunits making up the cytochrome b f and NDH complexes, but also revealed that components of many other plastid enzyme complexes were mis-regulated (either increased or decreased in abundance) (Supplementary Fig. 4C [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ). 
Values are quantified from Tapestation data shown in Supplementary Fig. 5, [this file] following normalisation to cytosolic 18 s rRNA. 
We also observed a significant reduction of chloroplast 30 S-associated 16 S rRNA in relative to WT, while levels of the 50 S-associated 23 S and 23 Sb rRNAs were similar or slightly increased (Fig. 3e [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
In contrast, no obvious differences in the sensitivity to the cytosolic ribosome inhibitor cycloheximide were observed (Supplementary Fig. 6A [this file] ). 
These mutations were based on conserved homologies to yeast NOT4 where the activities of both domains were successfully knocked out previously (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ) . 
Mutations in black are those introduced to the gene, which correspond to equivalent conserved residues in NOT4 (shown in grey), additionally highlighted in Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] sequence alignments. anti-GUS western blot of steady state levels of -GUS variants expressed in . 
Amongst these genes were 34 chloroplast-targeted PPR proteins, which collectively may be upregulated to compensate for compromised chloroplast translation in the mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6B [this file] , Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ) . Interestingly, we found that mRNA encoding one of these chloroplast-targeted PPR proteins, PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 3 (PGR3) (AT4G31850), was downregulated to undetectable levels in , but restored to WT levels in the N4A-G3 complementation line (Fig. 6b [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 6B [this file] ). As such, mutants have reduced levels of cytochrome b f and NDH, similar to (Fig. 2c–e [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 4A, B, D [this file] ) . 
Values are quantified from Tapestation data shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] , following normalisation to cytosolic 18 s rRNA. 
Reduced transcripts of and , but not , and , were detected in both and relative to their respective wildtypes, consistent with the requirement for PGR3 in stabilising these two RNAs (Fig. 6f [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 6C, D [this file] ). In contrast, steady state protein levels of the Rubisco subunit RBCL, PSII subunits D1 and PsbP, and the PSI-associated protein LHCA4 were not significantly altered relative to WT in either mutant under nonstressed conditions (Supplementary Fig. 4E [this file] ). Furthermore, there is a significant reduction in the 30 S associated 16 S rRNA in both mutants (Fig. 6g [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
We observed enhanced levels of SVR7 protein in relative to WT (Supplementary Fig. 6B [this file] ), perhaps compensating for loss of , and explaining why 50 S subunits are not affected in the mutant. The upregulation of PPR proteins SOT1, EMB2654, PPR4 and PPR2 (which all promote chloroplast rRNA maturation), and GUN1 (implicated in the production of chloroplast ribosomal subunits RPS1 and RPL11) present further evidence of compensatory responses to reduced ribosome abundance and protein synthesis within chloroplasts (Supplementary Fig. 6B [this file] ) . 
We therefore investigated the effect of ectopic xpression on phenotypes by transforming and Col-0 with a functional construct capable of complementing (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). PGR3-YFP protein levels were comparable across the Col-0 and lines, while transcripts were elevated between 2- and 6-fold above WT levels in all transgenics, with specific qPCR corroborating the proportional pattern of expression between lines (Fig. 7a, b [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 7B [this file] ). 
Experiment was replicated at least 3 times (see Supplementary Fig. 7D [this file] for further repeats). 10-day-old Col-0, and PGR3-YFP transgenic seedlings grown on vertical plates ±10 µM lincomycin. 
PGR3-YFP localized as expected within chloroplasts in both backgrounds (Fig. 7c [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 7D [this file] ). This is further supported by an inability to detect ubiquitin modification of immunoprecipitated PGR3-YFP (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ) and an absence of a protein-protein interaction between NOT4A and PGR3 when assayed by yeast two-hybrid (Fig. 7g [rid=Fig7] ). 
Remarkably however, introduction of the transgene was able to complement the pale-yellow and lincomycin-sensitive phenotypes of , despite the lack of expression (Fig. 7d, e [rid=Fig7] and Supplementary Fig. 7C [this file] ).

To complement our RNA-seq analysis and investigate differences in protein abundance in vs WT in more detail, we carried out a quantitative proteomics analysis of total protein extracts from 30-day-old whole plants as previously described (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). Analysis of the chloroplast-specific proteins in these datasets (619 in WT, 689 in Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] ) confirmed reduced levels of all detected subunits making up the cytochrome b f and NDH complexes, but also revealed that components of many other plastid enzyme complexes were mis-regulated (either increased or decreased in abundance) (Supplementary Fig. 4C [rid=MOESM1] and Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). 
See also Supplementary Data 2 [this file] . 
In addition to a reduction of photosynthetic proteins, we also observed a significant downregulation or absence of plastid ribosome proteins in (Fig. 3b, f [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). The reduction of 30 S subunits was only apparent at the protein level, as transcripts of the nuclear-encoded subunits were in fact elevated in the RNA-seq data (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). 
Amongst these genes were 34 chloroplast-targeted PPR proteins, which collectively may be upregulated to compensate for compromised chloroplast translation in the mutant (Supplementary Fig. 6B [rid=MOESM1] , Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ) .",xlsx,RETRACTED ARTICLE:The Arabidopsis NOT4A E3 ligase promotes PGR3 expression and regulates chloroplast translation,XML,,,,,,,

S1P could still be detected after elimination of the mitochondrial outer membrane, which indicated that S1P resides in the mitochondrial matrix space (Appendix Fig S1 [this file] ). 
To explore the molecular mechanism underlying the inflammatory symptoms, we screened S1P interactors by Co‐IP and liquid chromatography‐tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) and identified 29 potential candidates (Hosp , 2015 [rid=emmm202114904-bib-0022] ) (Fig 3A [rid=emmm202114904-fig-0003] , Appendix Table S2 [this file] ). We demonstrated a stable association between S1P and the ETFA/ETFB complex in HaCaT cells through a Co‐IP assay (Fig 3C [rid=emmm202114904-fig-0003] , Appendix Fig S2A [this file] ). Correspondingly, IVD, LYRM5, SARDH, and ACADS, known interactors with ETF, were immunoprecipitated from HaCaT cells with anti‐ETFB antibodies (Kim & Miura, 2004 [rid=emmm202114904-bib-0023] ; Floyd , 2016 [rid=emmm202114904-bib-0014] ) (Appendix Fig S2B [this file] ). S1P associated with SARDH (a known ETF substrate) in HaCaT cells (Appendix Fig S2C [this file] ). 
In addition, S1P reduced the association between ETFB and LYRM5 (a deflavinase of ETF) (Floyd , 2016 [rid=emmm202114904-bib-0014] ) but increased the association between ETFB and ACADS (a known ETF substrate) (Kim & Miura, 2004 [rid=emmm202114904-bib-0023] ) (Appendix Fig S2D [this file] ). 
No significant change in the concentration of succinate was observed (Fig 5B [rid=emmm202114904-fig-0005] , panel 3), and moderate accumulation of metabolic intermediates in the TCA cycle, such as succinyl‐CoA (by 147.8%) (Fig 5B [rid=emmm202114904-fig-0005] , panel 4), citrate (by 56.2%), oxaloacetate (by 55.8%), and α‐ketoglutarate (KG) (by 100.1%), was observed in HaCaT cells (Appendix Fig S3A [this file] ). 
Furthermore, we observed a compensatory increase in glycolytic metabolites, such as pyruvate (by 205.3%), ‐lactate (by 41.7%) (Fig 5B [rid=emmm202114904-fig-0005] , panels 5–6), D‐fructose 1,6‐bisphosphate (FDP) (by 50.7%), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) (by 2160.4%), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) (by 578.3%) (Appendix Fig S3B [this file] ), in KO HaCaT cells compared with the control. 
Given that S1P maintains the stability of ETF, we measured palmitoyl‐CoA‐induced enzymatic activity in ‐KO HaCaT cells and controls. ‐KO HaCaT cells exhibited impaired FAO activity compared with control cells (Appendix Fig S3C [this file] ). 
All antibodies and dilutions used for immunoblotting, immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, and immunoprecipitation were described in the Appendix Table S3 [this file] .",docx,,XML,,,,,,,

We validated these data in JAR, JEG3, and BeWo by performing PCR using a methylation‐specific (MS) primer and found a similar DNA methylation profile (Fig. S2 [this file] C). Additionally, we analyzed CpG methylation around the alternative promoter region of the main isoform (Fig. 2E [rid=mol213066-fig-0002] , gray box) by MS‐PCR (Fig. S2 [this file] B). Here, we also found the same DNA methylation profile as before, suggesting that the DNA methylation profile is comparable across the analyzed CpG island (Fig. S2 [this file] B). 
To correlate sample‐specific DNA methylation to CD24 protein levels, we performed IHC of related GCT samples and found that DNA methylation levels did not correlate to CD24 protein levels (Fig. 2B [rid=mol213066-fig-0002] , Fig. S2 [this file] D). Within each sample, we found the CpG island either fully methylated or completely demethylated, mimicking an imprinting‐like DNA methylation pattern (Fig. S2 [this file] B). 
By sodium bisulfite sequencing, we demonstrated that upregulation of expression coincided with demethylation of the CpG island in JAR cells 96 h after 20 (to 33%) and 50 n (to 10%) decitabine treatment (Fig. S2 [this file] E). 
Again, we found upregulation of in JEG3, BeWo, TCam‐2, GCT72, and JAR, but not in 2102EP, after 16 h of treatment (Fig. S2 [this file] D). How do other epidrugs, such as inhibitors against histone demethylases (HDMi; JIB‐04), histone methyltransferases (HMTi; GSK343), E3 ubiquitin ligases (E3‐ULi; PRT4165), and bromodomain‐containing proteins (BRDi, MZ‐1, and LP99), affect expression in GCT cell lines (for IC concentrations, see Fig. S2 [this file] E)?",tiff,The signal transducer CD24 suppresses the germ cell program and promotes an ectodermal rather than mesodermal cell fate in embryonal carcinomas,XML,,,,,,,

To identify genomic regions displaying developmental changes in 5mC levels, we searched the DNA methylome profiles for differentially methylated regions (DMRs; false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.05, minimum change in the fraction of methylated CpG sites (ΔmCG) = 0.2), identifying thousands of localized changes in methylation state that occur during embryonic development in each species ( Fig. 1b [href=#F1] , Supplementary Fig. 1a,b and Supplementary Tables 2–20 [href=this file] ). The identified DMRs displayed a median ΔmCG of 0.33–0.53 (zebrafish), 0.29–0.44 ( ) and 0.27–0.53 (mouse) ( Supplementary igs. 2–4 [href=this file] ). In zebrafish embryos, whereas the transition from the 1,000-cell stage (blastula) to the stage with 80% epiboly (gastrula) was characterized by both developmental hyper- and hypomethylation ( Fig. 1b [href=#F1] and Supplementary Fig. 2a,b [href=this file] ), the transitions associated with the phylotypic stage were overwhelmingly characterized by developmental hypomethylation (median ΔmCG = 0.33–0.44; Fig. 1b [href=#F1] and Supplementary Fig. 2 [href=this file] ). A similar trend could be observed in embryos, where almost no DMRs were identified between the blastula and gastrula stages ( Supplementary Fig. 1a [href=this file] ) and 5mC remodeling was mostly limited to demethylation (ΔmCG = 0.29–0.44) surrounding the phylotypic stage ( Fig. 1b [href=#F1] and Supplementary Fig. 3a,b [href=this file] ). Similarly, the majority of mouse DMRs found between the late gastrula (E7.5) and tailbud (E14.5) stages were being developmentally demethylated (ΔmCG = 0.38–0.43; Fig. 1b [href=#F1] and Supplementary Fig. 4 [href=this file] ).
We identified 63 conserved (shared by all species) and significantly enriched (FDR ≤ 0.01) terms for early phylotypic DMRs (late gastrula–phylotypic stage demethylation) and 70 such terms for late phylotypic DMRs (phylotypic stage–tailbud/fetus demethylation) ( Fig. 1c [href=#F1] and Supplementary Tables 21 and 22 [href=this file] ). Early mouse DMRs that became hypomethylated between E3.5 and E7.5 as well as later-stage DMRs that became hypermethylated between E9.5 and E14.5 were enriched in GO categories associated with embryonic development; however, these stages yielded far fewer significant categories than the ones associated with the phylotypic transitions ( Supplementary Figs. 5 [href=this file] and 6).
Furthermore, the extent of hypomethylation in phylo(−)DMRs was similar in 10 cells and 24 h.p.f. embryos for both early and late phylo(−)DMRs ( Supplementary Fig. 7a [href=this file] ). To explore whether these intermediate 5mC levels observed in 10 cells and 24 h.p.f. embryos are a result of different cell populations with either fully methylated or fully unmethylated sequences or of a uniform, partially methylated population, we plotted average mCG levels in individual sequencing reads for phylo(−)DMRs ( Supplementary Figs. 7b–d and 8 [href=this file] ). In mouse, however, a substantial proportion of the reads were found in a partially methylated state ( Supplementary Fig. 7b [href=this file] ), a finding that could be attributed either to demethylation intermediates or the formation of low-methylated regions displaying intermediate 5mC levels, as previously described in mammalian cell lines .
Notably, the other zebrafish DMR groups did not display such a strong enrichment in enhancer chromatin ( Supplementary Fig. 9a [href=this file] ). However, some of the identified DMRs that became developmentally hypermethylated (DMRs hypomethylated in the 1,000-cell stage and hypermethylated in the epiboly stage and DMRs hypomethylated in the epiboly stage and hypermethylated at 24 h.p.f.) overlapped the promoter regions of genes such as and , some of which were previously identified as differentially methylated between early embryos and differentiated tissues ( Supplementary Fig. 9b [href=this file] ). Whereas the CpG densities of phylo(−)DMRs in zebrafish and mouse were similar to that of CpG islands identified through pulldown of unmethylated DNA , phylo(−)DMRs, and in particular the early phylo(−)DMRs, displayed considerably lower CpG density than these CpG islands ( Fig. 2c [href=#F2] and Supplementary Fig. 10a [href=this file] ).
To provide further evidence that phylo(−)DMRs act as developmental enhancers, we intersected the mouse phylo(−)DMR genomic positions with the positions of previously validated enhancers from the VISTA enhancer browser database and obtained 13 intersections corresponding to active enhancers ( Supplementary Table 23 [href=this file] ). These regions displayed a mild degree of developmental demethylation; however, none of them overlapped with statistically significant mouse DMRs ( Supplementary Fig. 10b,c and Supplementary Table 23 [href=this file] ).
To investigate this hypothesis, we identified orthologous genes that were linked to phylo(-)DMRs in all the species examined ( Supplementary Table 24 [href=this file] ) and subjected them to pathway enrichment analyses . These analyses showed that orthologous phylo(−)DMR-linked genes were enriched in pathways such as Wnt, Notch and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, implicated in body plan and organ formation ( Supplementary Fig. 11 [href=this file] ).
Proteins displaying differential binding to unmethylated and methylated DNA oligonucleotides were identified by an adapted test on label-free quantification (LFQ) intensities ( Supplementary Figs. 12 and 13, and Supplementary Tables 25 and 26 [href=this file] ). We also performed absolute quantification of the nuclear extract proteomes ( Supplementary Fig. 12 [href=this file] ) to directly assess the effects of stage-specific protein abundance on binding enrichments. Of the 45 readers quantified, the differential binding of only 19 could be explained by different protein abundance ( Supplementary Fig. 13 [href=this file] ), thereby demonstrating the dynamics of the 5mC interactome during early vertebrate embryogenesis.
Forty-five of these 96 proteins showed conserved binding (47% < 1.1 × 10 , hypergeometric test) ( Fig. 3a,b [href=#F3] and Supplementary Fig. 6 [href=this file] ). Readers for cytosine, 5mC and 5hmC in mouse NPCs and 24 h.p.f. zebrafish embryos also displayed substantial overlap: 99 of 249 proteins (40% < 5 × 10 , hypergeometric test) for which orthologs are annotated in both species displayed conserved binding ( Fig. 3a,b [href=#F3] and Supplementary Fig. 14 [href=this file] ).
To assess whether phylo(−)DMRs become demethylated through an active mechanism that involves the 5hmC intermediate, we generated base-resolution maps of 5hmC in zebrafish (24 h.p.f.), (st. 30) and mouse (E9.5) embryos by Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing (TAB-seq) (for details on non-conversion and TAB-seq metrics, see Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ). Accordingly, the 5hmC signal in zebrafish and coincided with developmental demethylation taking place in both early and late phylo(−) DMRs ( Fig. 4d [href=#F4] and Supplementary Fig. 15 [href=this file] ). A similar pattern was observed for mouse late phylo(−) DMRs ( Fig. 4d [href=#F4] and Supplementary Fig. 15 [href=this file] ), whereas mouse early phylo(−)DMRs were already demethylated by E9.5 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [href=this file] ) and therefore did not show any localized 5hmC enrichment ( Fig. 4d [href=#F4] ). When superimposed over mouse early and late phylo(−)DMRs, both Tet1 and 5hmC displayed a strong enrichment over these regions in mouse ESCs ( Supplementary Fig. 16 [href=this file] ). Furthermore, a positive correlation between the quantity of 5hmC and Tet1 signal, as well as between Tet1 signals from different antibodies, was evident for both early and late phylo(−)DMRs ( Supplementary Fig. 16b [href=this file] ), thereby supporting the notion of Tet-dependent 5mC-5hmC conversion in phylo(−)DMRs during mammalian embryogenesis.
Embryos injected with tet3 morpholino showed only minor defects, with 23% of the morphants displaying varying degrees of microphthalmia ( Supplementary Fig. 17a [href=this file] ), as previously reported in a morpholino study performed in embryos . The triple morphants were severely affected, with the majority displaying embryonic lethality, while the embryos that survived gastrulation (23%) displayed short and blended axes, impaired head structures, small eyes and reduced pigmentation ( Supplementary Fig. 17a [href=this file] ), comparable to the defects recently described in a - - zebrafish knockout . We next performed WGBS (for details, see Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ) on morphant embryos ( = 50) and compared the 5mC profiles to their counterparts in wildtype embryos. No differences in 5mC increase were observed between early and late phylo(−)DMRs, and no other DMR population displaying developmental demethylation was affected by this perturbation ( Supplementary Fig. 17b,c [href=this file] ). Also, there was an increase in mCG levels in a subpopulation of CpG islands that corresponded to phylo(−)DMRs and, thus, with sites of aberrant demethylation in the morphants ( Fig. 5a [href=#F5] and Supplementary Fig. 17d,e [href=this file] ).
We therefore performed ATAC-seq on two pools of morphant embryos and their wild-type counterparts (for ATAC-seq metrics, see Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ). Of note, unsupervised clustering of the zebrafish embryonic transcriptomes identified a cluster encompassing the morphant samples, their wild-type controls and other zebrafish phylotypic-stage samples , indicative of morpholino phenotype specificity rather than a developmental delay caused by knockdown ( Supplementary Fig. 18 [href=this file] ). Differential gene expression analyses showed bidirectional changes in gene transcript abundance in morphants ( = 718 upregulated genes and = 780 downregulated genes in the morphant) ( Fig. 5e [href=#F5] and Supplementary Table 27 [href=this file] ). GO analyses of downregulated genes showed an over-representation of functions associated with transcriptional regulation, similar to those described to be enriched among zebrafish phylo(−)DMR-associated genes ( Fig. 5f [href=#F5] and Supplementary Fig. 5 [href=this file] ), whereas no statistically significant gene ontology enrichments were associated with the upregulated group of genes.
Single-read MethylC-seq libraries (for details, see Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ) were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform. To estimate the bisulfite non-conversion frequency the frequency of all cytosine base calls at reference cytosine positions in the lambda phage genome (unmethylated spike-in control) was normalized by the total number of base calls at reference cytosine positions in the lambda phage genome ( Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ).
Single-read TAB-seq libraries (for details, see Supplementary Table 1 [href=this file] ) were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 1500 platform.
The output of the methylpy pipe-line is provided as Supplementary Tables 2–5 [href=this file] .
We also designed a specific splice-junction morpholino for the zebrafish Tet3 protein ( Supplementary Table 28 [href=this file] ).

EJC library enrichment was also readily discernible for NMD, NSD, retained intron, and processed transcript isoforms (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] c and Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2A), with median enrichments falling between 1.8 and 2.6-fold (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S2B). 
The position of an exon junction in an individual read can be found by examining the “N operation” in the CIGAR string, which indicates the locations and lengths of gaps inserted during alignment to genomic DNA (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S3). We further required that any candidate junction (1) occurs within an annotated gene; (2) has reads with ≥ 15 nt aligning on both sides of the junction (≥ 90% exact sequence match on each side); (3) be detectable in all replicates of a particular library type; and (4) has a mean read count ≥ 2 per library type (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S3). 
The majority (76%) of previously annotated exon junctions meeting our detection criteria in protein-coding genes (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S3) were present in all three library types (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] c, left). 
Plotting MaxENT versus conservation revealed markedly different distributions between annotated splice sites and random GT- and AG-containing sequences (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] b and Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S4A-B), with annotated sites being notably skewed toward higher values for both measures. In contrast, whereas unannotated splice sites were similarly distributed as annotated splice sites with regard to MaxENT, the majority exhibited conservation scores more similar to random than annotated splice sites (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] c and Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S4C). The majority of these occurred within annotated protein-coding exons, so their conservation is likely driven by amino acid conservation and not as a requirement for recognition by the splicing machinery (see Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5A for an example). In contrast, examination of unannotated 3′ splice sites occurring within introns uncovered a conserved alternative splicing event in the HECTD4 (HECT domain E3 ubiquitin protein ligase 4) gene that adds 9 amino acids into the middle of the protein (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5B); this spliced isoform is currently annotated in mouse RefSeq and GENCODE, but not in humans. 
Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S4A shows the same plot for all observed annotated splice sites. also contains 2268 random GT-containing (left) and 2693 random AG-containing (right) sites; identical plots for four additional sets of randomized locations are shown in Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S4B. Genes for which genome browser tracks are shown in panels and and in Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5A and B are indicated. 
Other high-abundance examples were a 103 nt exon in intron 3 of the 29-intron DNA Polymerase Theta (POLQ) gene (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S5C) and a 69 nt exon in intron 37 of the 39-intron pleckstrin homology domain interacting protein (PHIP) gene (Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] d). 
Similar results were observed for other RNA-binding protein genes known to maintain protein homeostasis by AS-NMD (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S1). 
However, the harringtonine (+) and (−) RNA-Seq data in this study clearly show that this treatment had no discernible effect on either protein-coding or AS-NMD isoform abundance in actively dividing HEK293 cells (Figs. 1 [rid=Fig1] and 2 [rid=Fig2] and Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S1–2). While the 15-min exposure had almost no effect on protein-coding isoform abundance, the 24-h exposure did [ 45 [rid=CR45] , 46 [rid=CR46] ] (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S6A). Our analysis of those data revealed that the 15-min cycloheximide treatment was sufficient to increase AS-NMD isoform abundance, with this increase being even more apparent at 24 h (Additional file 1 [this file] : Figure S6B).

Using these values as cutoffs to filter out the majority of events likely due to splicing noise (although this may be unnecessarily conservative for 3′ splice sites due to the high degree of overlap between the annotated and random conservation scores) left us with 453 (23%) and 651 (28%) evolutionarily conserved unannotated 5′ and 3′ splice sites, respectively (Additional file 3 [this file] : Table S3). 
Combining these exon conservation scores (white to dark blue in Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] b) with the previously calculated 5′ and 3′ splice site conservation scores (Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] b) revealed a set of 20 previously unannotated cassette exons exhibiting both high internal (phyloP score ≥ 1) and high splice site (≥ 1 for both splice sites) conservation (Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] b, right; Additional file 3 [this file] : Table S3).",txt,Deep sequencing of pre-translational mRNPs reveals hidden flux through evolutionarily conserved alternative splicing nonsense-mediated decay pathways,XML,,,,,,,

A large fraction of ChAT+ motor neurons in the ventral horn of wild type (WT) spinal cords were NEK1 (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). In addition, NEK1 was detected in CD31 endothelial cells and IBA1 microglia in WT mouse brains (Supplementary Fig. 1c-d [this file] ). 
Inhibition of RIPK1, however, did not affect the polycystic kidney development, dwarfism, or facial deformity in this mutant line (Supplementary Fig. 1e-g [this file] ). Inhibition of RIPK1 did not rescue the reduced body weight in mice at 2 weeks of age (Supplementary Fig. 1h [this file] ). While inhibition of RIPK1 rescued the lethality of mice to allow their survival, the body weight of mice at 5 months of age was still lower than that of WT or mice (Supplementary Fig. 1i [this file] ). 
Inhibition of RIPK1 blocked the immunostaining signals of p-S166 RIPK1, p-S345 MLKL, and cleaved caspase-3 in the brains of mice at 3 weeks of age (Fig. 1c–f [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1j [this file] ). 
Treatment of MEFs, but not MEFs, with TNF induced cell death, which was prevented by RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s (R-7-Cl-O-Nec-1) (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). MEFs were also sensitized to RDA induced by a combination of TNF and TAK1 inhibitor, 5z7 (5z-7-Oxozeaenol) and necroptosis induced by TNF/5z7/zVAD (Supplementary Fig. 2b, c [this file] ). Knockdown of using shRNA also sensitized RGC5 cells and L929 cells to RDA and necroptosis, which was protected by RIPK1 inhibition with Nec-1s (Supplementary Fig. 2d-f [this file] ). 
Furthermore, we found that the levels of total A20 protein were much lower in cells relative to WT, but A20 mRNA levels were not affected by deficiency (Fig. 2a [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Fig. 2g [this file] ). Consistent with A20 deficiency , the phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα in MEFs stimulated by TNF was increased compared to that of WT (Supplementary Fig. 2h [this file] ). 
We stained brain slices from , , and WT littermates with thioflavin S, which marks misfolded protein aggregates (Fig. 3a, b [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Strikingly, we found that the levels of α-synuclein were elevated in the hippocampal and cortical neurons of mice compared to that of WT littermates (Fig. 3c–e [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). 
Increased mRNA levels of ﻿, , , , , and were observed in primary microglia compared to primary microglia WT littermates (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). 
In contrast, the expression of Cst7 in primary microglia isolated from mice was increased by 1.48x (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). is highly induced in the CNS in microglia from the ALS mouse model , human Alzheimer’s disease brains (AD), the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD , aging microglia, during demyelination , and in a prion disease model . 
Consistent with the induction of DAM, the expression of all other known DAM signature genes including , (6.14x), (4.26x), , , , , (77.17x), (44.81x), , and (10.79x), except , were also highly elevated in the brains of Nek1 mice, which were suppressed by the inhibition of RIPK1 in mice (Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ). In contrast, the markers of homeostatic microglia, such as , , , , and , were not elevated, or minimally induced, such as (1.85x), (3.61x) and (3.04x), in the brains of mice, which were also suppressed by the inhibition of RIPK1 in the brains of mice (Supplementary Fig. 3e [this file] ). 
We found that NEK1 bound to VPS26B and VPS35 (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ) and furthermore, knockdown of VPS26B and VPS29 sensitized cells to necroptosis (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). Furthermore, we found that knockdown of VPS26B sensitized WT, but not MEFs, to RDA and necroptosis; while knockdown of VPS29 or VPS26A sensitized both WT and MEFs to RDA and necroptosis, which was inhibited by treatment with RIPK1 inhibitor Nec-1s (Fig. 4a, b [rid=Fig4] ; Supplementary Fig. 4c-f [this file] ). 
In our mass spectrometry analysis of cell surface proteins, the plasma membrane levels of SNX27 were much higher in MEFs compared to WT MEFs, while the plasma membrane levels of another sorting nexin protein SNX2, a retromer binding protein that regulates the retrieval of proteins from endosome to Golgi apparatus , was much lower in compared to WT MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 4g [this file] ). 
Using mass spectrometry analysis, we identified that NEK1 could phosphorylate Ser302 and Ser304 of VPS26B (Supplementary Fig. 4h [this file] ). 
We found that the C-terminus of VPS26B is important for binding between VPS26B and SNX27 as a truncation of VPS26B that lacks the C-terminal 298-336 residues bound poorly with endogenous SNX27 (Supplementary Fig. 4i [this file] ). Addback of VPS26B and VPS26B , but not VPS26B , rescued VPS26B knockdown cells from the sensitization to cell death stimuli (Supplementary Fig. 4j, k [this file] ). 
In contrast, the levels of SNX2 in the cell surface membrane were decreased in VPS26B knockdown MEFs expressing VPS26B and increased in VPS26B knockdown MEFs expressing VPS26B (Supplementary Fig. 4l [this file] ). 
Reduced plasma membrane presence of GLUT1 was not affected by treatment of Nec-1s (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ), which is consistent with the model that activation of RIPK1 is downstream of retromer defects in Nek1 deficient cells. 
The reduced plasma membrane levels of GLUT1 in MEFs were restored by the expression of WT NEK1 but not NEK1 , a kinase dead mutant of NEK1, suggesting the importance of NEK1 kinase activity in regulating the trafficking of GLUT1 (Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] ). 
Longer term C-labelling experiment also demonstrated the reduction in the levels of pyruvate in MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). With reduced precursor metabolites such as pyruvate from glycolysis, the TCA activity of MEFs was also compromised, which were evidenced by the reduced oxygen consumption rate in seahorse analysis (Supplementary Fig. 5d [this file] ), reduced levels of acetyl-coA (Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] ) and reduced levels of ATP (Supplementary Fig. 5f [this file] ). Consistent with reduced glucose uptake and the activation of starvation response, MEFs showed higher levels of p-S79 ACC, a substrate of AMPK, than that of WT (Supplementary Fig. 5g [this file] ). The levels of p-S79 ACC in and WT MEFs were elevated to the same levels when treated with metformin, which is known to activate AMPK (Supplementary Fig. 5g [this file] ). Treatment with Nec-1s had no effect on the levels of p-ACC (Supplementary Fig. 5h [this file] ). 
Consistence with the expression of VPS26B and VPS26B promoted the localization of GLUT1 to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5d, e [rid=Fig5] ), addback of VPS26B and VPS26B significantly rescued the decreased glucose uptake and acetyl-CoA levels in VPS26B knockdown cells, while the addback of VPS26B showed no significant effect on glucose uptake and acetyl-CoA levels in VPS26B knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 5i, j [this file] ). 
We found that ALCAR pretreatment reduced the sensitivity of MEFs to RDA and necroptosis, while effects on WT MEFs were minimal (Fig. 6a [rid=Fig6] ; Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ). 
The protein levels of LAMP1 were also increased in MEFs compared to that of WT MEFs (Fig. 6f [rid=Fig6] ). deficiency resulted in dramatically decreased lysosomal activity as determined by the cathepsin B activity assay using the Magic Red probe and increased protein levels of p62, which were not affected by the treatment with Nec-1s (Fig. 6f [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). Consistent with increased levels of α-synuclein in the brains of mice, MEFs transfected with an expression vector of α-synuclein showed increased accumulation compared to WT MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 6c [this file] ). ALCAR pretreatment showed no obvious effect on the cathepsin B activity assay using the Magic Red probe, protein levels of p62 and LAMP1, nor did it have any significant effect on the enlarged LAMP1 lysosome size in MEFs (Supplementary Fig. 6d–f [this file] ). 
Addback of VPS26B and VPS26B , but not VPS26B , reduced the enlarged lysosomes and mitochondria fragmentation in VPS26B knockdown cells (Supplementary Fig. 6g, h [this file] ). 
Consistent with inadequate glucose uptake in cells, we found the acetyl-CoA levels were also lower in cells (Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] ). Consistent with the decreased acetyl-CoA levels, the acetylation of A20 protein was much lower in cells (Supplementary Fig. 6i [this file] ). We found that treatment with ALCAR or sodium octanoate substantially rescued the A20 protein levels in MEFs (Fig. 6i [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Fig. 6j [this file] ). Treatment with Nec-1s has no effects on the enlarged lysosomes, decreased glucose uptake into cells, decreased acetyl-CoA levels and mitochondrial fragmentation in cells (Supplementary Fig. 6k–n [this file] ). 
In contrast to substantial amount of extravasated Evans blue in the brains of mice on control diet, newborns from mothers who had been on ketogenic diet since pregnancy showed no extravasated Evans blue (Fig. 7b [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). Ketogenic diet also inhibited necroptosis and RDA of cerebrovascular endothelial cells in the brains of mice; no obvious phosphorylation of MLKL or cleaved caspase-3 were observed in the brains of mice on ketogenic diet (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c [this file] ). The ketogenic diet showed no significant effects on body weight of WT and mice compared to the control diet (Supplementary Fig. 7d, e [this file] ). Taken together, we conclude that the the preweaning lethality of mice can be reduced by inhibition of RIPK1 as well as by ketogenic diet which can rescue metabolic defects to inhibit RIPK1 mediated cell death and inflammation (Supplementary Fig. 7f [this file] ).",pptx,NEK1-mediated retromer trafficking promotes blood–brain barrier integrity by regulating glucose metabolism and RIPK1 activation,XML,,,,,,,

Neither ZIKV protein was detectable in inoculated EVT samples (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ), supporting the minimal increase of infectious virus seen in plaque assays. Full Western Blots and isotype control immunofluorescence images are shown in Supplementary Figs. 2 [this file] and 3 [this file] , respectively. 
Full heatmaps presented in Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] show a similar clustering pattern when genes that were only detected in as few as one sample were included. 
Cell type comparisons can be found in Supplementary Table 4 [this file] . ( ) Normalized CPMs by DESeq2 for candidate ZIKV receptors. ( , ) Top 10 canonical pathways identified by IPA in the TSC and ST3D datasets [− log (p-value)]. 
The expression of seven of the genes involved in the antiviral response pathway ( and ) and two genes involved in the anti-apoptosis pathway ( and ) were validated with qRT-PCR (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] E; primer sequences Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). The trends in expression observed with qRT-PCR agreed with those identified by poly(A)-seq analysis (Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). A trend in decreased expression of and was confirmed in TSC-Z samples by qRT-PCR, supporting the RNAseq data. p-values are listed in Supplementary Table 5 [this file] . There was no significant difference in PPAR14 expression with ZIKV exposure, but there was a difference between cell types (Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
A significant difference was not detected in CG or progesterone secretion with ZIKV exposure, although there were significant cell type-dependent changes in CG secretion (TS vs ST3D, p < 0.001; TS vs EVT, p < 0.001; Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
Cytokines and growth factors associated with infection and the inflammatory response were quantified by Luminex assay (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] B,C). ( ) was significantly upregulated in infected ST3Ds compared to control (a similar trend was observed in mRNA expression, Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] B), and was more highly expressed in infected ST3Ds compared to infected TSCs. Regardless of infection status, there were significant differences in the secretion of several cytokines and growth factors between trophoblast cell types (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] B). Conversely, significant differences were not detected across cell type or infection status (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] C). p-values for hormones and analytes are listed in Supplementary Table 5 [this file] . 
The ZIKV E protein was readily detected in the TSC-Z and ST3D-Z EV samples with none detected in the EVT-Z EV samples or any controls (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] C; Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] D). 
Three peptides aligned with the capsid and membrane ZIKV structural proteins (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Full heatmaps, of all significantly differentially detected proteins, are present in Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] . 
For the top 1000 genes identified in the eight EV poly(A)-seq samples, DAVID enrichment analysis showed that the most enriched cellular component was extracellular exosome (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] A). When comparison was restricted to transcripts detected in a majority of samples regardless of cell type origin (3/5 control or 2/3 ZIKV-exposed; Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] B), 832 and 601 transcripts were detected only in control or ZIKV EVs, respectively. Pathways enriched by transcripts identified in the majority of ZIKV or control EVs (602 and 871 for ZIKV and control, respectively) are shown in Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] C. IPA analysis identified several pathways to be significantly increased (cholecystokinin/Gastrin-mediated, protein kinase A, senescence, and Rho family GTPase signaling) and decreased (RHOA, ILK, and PFKFB4 signaling; Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] C) by ZIKV exposure. 
TSCs were differentiated into either EVTs or ST3D aggregates (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] A). TSCs were grown in 13 ml media, EVTs in 15 ml media, and ST3Ds in 10 ml media (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] B). 
The number of ST3D “cells” (at this point they are aggregates) present was based on the number of TSCs added to the flask three days prior (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] B). 
At the end of the culture period, TSCs were lifted, EVTs were scraped off the flasks, and ST3Ds were pelleted prior to aliquoting cells for RNA, DNA, and protein isolation (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] A). 
For antibody details please see Supplementary Table 1 [this file] . 
For this assay, additional cells were inoculated at the same MOI and length of duration as previously stated and shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] A. 
Beta-actin mRNA was amplified in parallel to serve as the reference gene and the primer sequences are listed in Supplementary Table 2 [this file] . cDNA was diluted 1:10 and reactions were run in triplicate. 
To detect ZIKV, the E and nonstructural protein 2B (NS2B) antibodies were used; see Supplementary Table 1 [this file] for antibody information.

The identifications can therefore be retained as is or filtered to a lower false discovery rate by means of linear discriminant analysis ( Figure 3(b) [rid=F3] , Methods §4.5, and Supplementary Note 1.3 [this file] ), though this comes at the cost of decreasing the number of on-target identifications. 
We tested the robustness of Specter in such situations and found that its output is largely unaffected when precursors are removed individually or en masse from a spectral library ( Supplementary Figures 2 and 3 [this file] ). 
We used three families of synthetic peptides, each consisting of precursors whose spectra are highly similar and whose / ratios (in charge state +2) fall into the same isolation windows for DIA ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
This is also an example of a situation in which the use of library retention time information would improve the results of Specter, as a two-minute window for identification around the elution times for LPVLAVNGQIR and LPVLANGVQIR would have made these false peaks impossible (though this still would not necessarily result in a positive identification of LPVLANVGQIR, as per Supplementary Figure 3 [this file] ). 
We found that DIA with analysis by Specter is more reproducible than DDA, due to large numbers of precursors which are identified in one replicate DDA run but not another, or which exhibit high variability in their quantifications between runs ( Supplementary Figure 4(a) [this file] ). Fig. 4(b) [this file] ; average across DDA replicates = 0.72, average across DIA replicates = 0.98). 
We calculated the accuracy of quantification by Specter following the LFQ Bench study methods and compared to the other tools ( Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ) . 
The maximum similarities (normalized dot products) between the unique Specter identifications and all other library spectra are, in a statistically significant fashion, higher overall than these values for the unique Spectronaut identifications ( Supplementary Figure 5 [this file] ), with a mean of 0.74 as opposed to 0.64 for Spectronaut ( -value of one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov test = 5.24 x 10 ). 
For each MS2 scan , the / coordinates of the peaks of the library spectra are then binned with the / coordinates of the peaks of to obtain a vector of intensities whose length equals the number of peaks of ( Supplementary Note 1.1 [this file] ). 
In order to account for peaks of library spectra not matching peaks in , as described above, we append a zero to the end of this vector so that it has length This extra zero serves to penalize the linear contributions of library spectra that have peaks with significant intensities that aren’t present in Let be the corresponding matrix of normalized reference spectra constructed above (see also Supplementary Note 1.1 [this file] ). Some peaks of may not be close to any of the peaks of the reference spectra, as determined using the mass accuracy δ, and these may be discarded from the analysis as they don’t affect the determination of the optimal linear combination ( Supplementary Note 1.2 [this file] ), i.e. we project the spectrum to the linear span of the library spectra prior to analysis. 
With these unnecessary peaks removed, the optimal linear combination of the reference spectra is determined as the solution of the corresponding nonnegative least squares problem, which finds the vector of length (where is the number of spectral library members), all of whose entries are nonnegative, such that the matrix product of with is as close as possible to in the Euclidean norm among all such nonnegative vectors ( Supplementary Note 1.2 [this file] ). 
Equations for these scores are given in Supplementary Note 1.3 [this file] . 
The HEK293T digest was resuspended using 0.1%TFA and a mixture containing ninety-six synthetic peptides at known individual concentrations ( Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ) was spiked into it to generate a five-point calibration curve. 
For spike-in experiments, synthetic peptide mixtures were constructed according to Supplementary Table 5 [this file] . 20 injections worth of peptide mixtures for each of the zero, single, or double drop out samples were created.

Figures  S1–S6  and  Tables  S1–S3,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"The rodent and human structure of the gene is complex, consisting of multiple 5′ exons, each containing its own promoter and 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR), that are alternatively spliced to a universal coding exon [xref] [rid=bib16] [xref] [rid=bib17] [xref] [rid=bib18] ( Figure S1 [this file] A). 
The expression of isoforms was analyzed by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) with a reverse primer complementary to universal exon IX and forward primers matching each 5′UTR ( Figure S1 [this file] A). 
See also Figure S1 [this file] . 
In the nucleus, the genome is arranged into self-interacting TADs in which DNA sequences contact each other more frequently. [xref] [rid=bib42] [xref] [rid=bib43] Strengthening of intra-TAD and depletion of inter-TAD contacts have been observed during neuronal development, and new TAD boundaries form near developmentally regulated genes as they become transcriptionally active. [xref] [rid=bib44] To study the TAD boundaries that regulate gene interactions, we analyzed high-resolution HiC data of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) differentiated into NPCs and cortical neurons. [xref] [rid=bib44] We discovered a sub-TAD encompassing the gene and a downstream, gene-free region adjacent to the closest gene ( Figure S1 [this file] B). The sub-TAD falls at the 3′ end of a larger TAD and, despite the dramatic difference in expression, its contact frequencies appeared similar in NPCs and cortical neurons ( Figure S1 [this file] B). 
CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) and cohesin are key regulators of TAD boundaries, [xref] [rid=bib45] [xref] [rid=bib46] and are known to bind to the locus at promoter IV and intron 7 in mouse neurons. [xref] [rid=bib47] Loss of either CTCF or cohesin compromises transcription from promoter IV, increasing repressive histone modifications. [xref] [rid=bib47] Analysis of published CTCF Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with sequencing (ChIP-seq) data [xref] [rid=bib44] identified peaks in the and genes in both NPCs and cortical neurons at sites coinciding with the sub-TAD boundaries ( Figure S1 [this file] B). CTCF binding site 1 spans exon II, but the highest enrichment of CTCF was observed at binding site 2, located on the downstream part of exon VII and extending into the intron ( Figures S1 [this file] B and S1C). ChIP-qPCR for the cohesin subunit Rad21 confirmed cohesin binding to CTCF site 2 in primary NPCs and PMNs ( Figure S1 [this file] C). In PMNs, low levels of Rad21 enrichment were seen at site 1 and at the site, which were significantly above the IgG control ( Figure S1 [this file] C). 
The profile appeared the same irrespective of the expression levels in the cell type ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] A), consistent with the HiC analysis ( Figure S1 [this file] B). 
See also Figure S2 [this file] . 
The use of a reciprocal combination of probe labels further supported this conclusion ( Figure S2 [this file] ). 
Sensitivity to DNase I is a feature of active chromatin regions including promoters and enhancers. [xref] [rid=bib53] ENCODE DNase I hypersensitivity data showed peaks atin brain ( Figure 3 [rid=fig3] A), but not in other tissues, which was similar to the pattern of DNase I hypersensitivity observed at promoters ( Figure S3 [this file] A). 
See also Figure S3 [this file] and Table S1 [this file] . 
We then investigated other enhancer hallmarks atusing ChIP-seq datasets generated by our and other laboratories ( Table S1 [this file] [xref] [rid=bib55] [xref] [rid=bib56] [xref] [rid=bib57] ). CBP and the MED23 Mediator subunit were also found to bind toin cortical neurons ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] A and S3 [this file] B), together with the transcription factors MEF2, CREB and TBR1 ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] A and S3 [this file] B). 
Primary cortical neurons were depolarized with KCl, and eRNA levels were assessed with qRT-PCR.eRNA increased concomitant with mRNA ( Figure S4 [this file] A). The activity-dependent Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors JUN and FOS were recruited toin response to neuronal depolarization ( Figure S4 [this file] B), which is consistent with transcription factors encoded by early response genes, like and , controlling the expression of late response genes, such as . [xref] [rid=bib72] 
After 5 DIV, the media was supplemented with puromycin to select lentiviral-transduced cells, and then cells were depolarized with KCl at DIV 7 for 3h before harvesting ( Figure S4 [this file] C). Expression ofeRNA after neuronal activation was significantly decreased in the presence of enhancer-targeted guide RNAs ( Figure S4 [this file] D). Although we did not detect a significant reduction of total mRNA afterinhibition ( Figure S4 [this file] E), analysis of different isoforms indicated thatinhibition resulted in lower expression of variants as a group ( Figure S4 [this file] F), confirming its role as an enhancer. Significant effects ofinhibition were seen on variants containing exon II and V ( Figure S4 [this file] F). We did not see a reduction in mRNA or antisense promoter transcription at −2.0 kb ( Figure S4 [this file] G), confirming that the CRISRPi inhibitory effect at the enhancer does not spread into the adjacent promoter. 
See also Figures S4 [this file] and S5 [this file] . 
Depolarization of cortical neurons in the presence of EV increased neuritic arborization, which was reduced byinhibition ( Figure S5 [this file] ). Co-transfection of pBdnf rescued the branching defects close to the soma, although it did not fully reinstate the branching in distal dendrites ( Figure S5 [this file] ). 
Initial experiments performed on NPCs in culture indicated that inhibition ofaffected PMN cluster formation, quantified by measuring nuclei-nuclei distance ( Figures S6 [this file] A and S6B). PMN dispersion was reversed by co-infection with a lentiviral vector encoding ( Figure S6 [this file] C), indicating that Bdnf is necessary for neuron-neuron interaction, cell migration, or adhesion properties . 
See also Figure S6 [this file] . 
Its inhibition significantly regulates the expression of at least five 5′ isoforms during differentiation ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] D), and at least two in response to depolarization ( Figure S4 [this file] F).bears most known enhancer hallmarks, including binding of CBP and Mediator, chromatin accessibility, specific histone modifications, and transcription ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] and S3 [this file] ). Analysis of genome topology revealed that gene and enhancer are located within a sub-TAD which is bounded by CTCF and cohesin ( Figures S1 [this file] B and S1C). activation correlates with increasing frequency of enhancer-promoter co-localization ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] C and S2 [this file] ) and movement of the genomic region away from the nuclear periphery ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] D).inhibition altered neuronal clustering ( Figure S6 [this file] ), dendritic branching ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] B and S5 [this file] ), and cortical development ( Figure 6 [rid=fig6] ), demonstrating its key role in regulating Bdnf functions and . 
We explored the 3D genome architecture of the genomic region using HiC and 4C-seq and described, for the first time, a sub-TAD of increased interaction frequency that includes the gene and the downstream region includingand the neuronal gene , with CTCF and cohesin-positive boundaries within the and genes ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] A, 2B, S1 [this file] B, and S1C). Neither the sub-TAD boundaries nor the enhancer-promoter loop sites changed during neuronal differentiation ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] A and S1 [this file] B), suggesting that the boundaries are pre-wired in NPCs. Topological structure has been shown to precede gene activation in many model systems, [xref] [rid=bib84] [xref] [rid=bib85] [xref] [rid=bib86] [xref] [rid=bib87] [xref] [rid=bib88] and preconfigured loops prime genes for transcriptional activation. [xref] [rid=bib89] Single cell imaging showed an increase in co-localization ofwith the promoter during the activation of the gene ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] C and S2 [this file] ), suggesting that the sub-TAD organization may facilitate enhancer-promoter interaction and transcription. 
During differentiation,inhibition markedly affected isoforms containing exon IV, V, VI, VIII, and IXa ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] ), whereas in response to depolarization, the strongest effect ofinhibition was on exon V and exon II- expressing isoforms ( Figure S4 [this file] F). 
In addition to promoting the formation of neuronal clusters ( Figure S6 [this file] ) and dendritogenesis ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] and S5 [this file] ),is necessary for mouse cortical neuron development ( Figure 6 [rid=fig6] ). The effect on neuronal migration could be linked to the neurite extension phenotype seen ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] and S5 [this file] ) because neuronal polarity and morphology are tightly interlinked with migration. [xref] [rid=bib79] Moreover,inhibition caused a loss of bipolar morphology in neurons that reached the cortical plate, which was restored by co-electroporation with a vector expressing Bdnf ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] D and 6E).

 Figure S1A.  Non-comprehensive overview of major growth signaling functions of PP2A complexes. A key mechanism by which PP2A exerts its tumor suppressive role resides in controlling several components downstream of RAS signaling, including PI3K/AKT, MEK/ERK and JAK/STAT, thereby preventing anomalous cell survival, growth and migration. PP2A is also more directly involved in preventing activation of diverse proto-oncogenes, including β-catenin and c-MYC, as well as in promoting activation of major tumor suppressors, such as p53 and pRb. Other established roles of PP2A occur in regulation of apoptosis, autophagy, cell division and protein synthesis.  Figure S1B.

Additional regulation of phosphatase activity or holoenzyme assembly occurs by endogenous cellular PP2A inhibitory proteins, such as SET, ANP32A, TIPRL, CIP2A, PME-1/PPME-1 and ARPP19, and cellular PP2A activators, such as IGBP1 and PTPA/PPP2R4.

Structurally, PP2A phosphatases are composed of at least two subunits, one of which is the catalytic C subunit, and one is the structural A subunit (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. S1B) [ 21 [rid=CR21] ]. In human cells, these three subunit classes are encoded by 19 different genes (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. S1B). PP2A activity is further regulated by several endogenous inhibitors (e.g., KIAA1524/CIP2A, SET), the expression of which is often increased in cancer cells [ 22 [rid=CR22] , 23 [rid=CR23] ], and by cellular activators (e.g., PTPA), the expression of which is often decreased in tumors [ 24 [rid=CR24] , 25 [rid=CR25] ] (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. S1B). 
They identified a set of 62 genes that could classify the PDAC into subclasses (PDAssign, Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1) [ 5 [rid=CR5] ]. 
This web-based software is backed by the Ingenuity Knowledge Base of highly structured, detail-rich biological and chemical findings obtained through datamining in literature and other databases, and is constantly updated (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1). 
Protein phosphatase 2 (PP2A): We selected a list of 59 search terms (gene symbols and synonyms) based on literature (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1). 
In short, the poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified, converted into cDNA and sequence-libraries of each sample were equimolarly pooled and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 (100 bp, Single Reads, v1.5) (for full methods: see Additional file 1 [this file] ). 
To demonstrate an association in patients between PP2A and EMT, we performed hierarchical clustering in dataset GSE15471 (GSE15471) now using a PP2A gene list (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1). 
A full list of results for PP2A and EMT-genes in the different datasets is given in the Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S2. 
Tumor samples were clustered based on PDAssign, EMT or PP2A gene sets (see Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1), each classifier resulted in two clusters. 
In addition, twenty-four-hour culture with OA had a stronger effect on gene expression (6300 of 12,400 genes showed altered expression with a log >+ 1 or < − 1) than long-term culture (only 2749 and 2863 genes for clones 7A and 7G respectively showed altered expression—see also Fig. 5 [rid=Fig5] A vs Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S3), suggesting adaptation over time. 
Notably, e.g., expression of and changed in opposite directions in short-term vs. long-term treated cells, whereas e.g. and , responded in the same way (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S3, Fig. 7 [rid=Fig7] A). 
In addition, as observed for the EMT genes, some PP2A genes were oppositely affected in short- versus long-term treated conditions (e.g., and many of the endogenous PP2A inhibitor genes) (Fig. 7 [rid=Fig7] B) (detailed numbers shown for OA7G in Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S3). 
Of these, the proteins present in the EMT list and those from the PP2A list were selected and subsequently analyzed by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 7 [rid=Fig7] C, D—statistical overview in Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S4). 
At the protein level, we found limited effects on PP2A expression in the cells treated for 24 h (OA-SH), while a shift becomes more pronounced in clone OA7G, and clone OA7A showed an intermediate change in PP2A protein expression pattern (Fig. 7 [rid=Fig7] D and Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S4A). For the EMT markers, each of the conditions has its own protein expression pattern (Fig. 7 [rid=Fig7] C and Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S4B). Differential expression evaluation versus untreated cells confirmed the clustering, while, between the clones, no statistical difference was identified (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S4).",pdf,Human pancreatic cancer patients with Epithelial-to-Mesenchymal Transition and an aggressive phenotype show a disturbed balance in Protein Phosphatase Type 2A expression and functionality,XML,,,,,,,

For example, RBPJ/CBF1, a TF that plays a central role in Notch signalling (Tanigaki & Honjo, 2010 [rid=b70] ), is functionally annotated to be linked with the Notch signalling pathway ( Supplementary Fig S4A [this file] ). These results agree well with the known diverse functions of FOXO3 in these processes ( Supplementary Fig S4B [this file] ). Moreover, both RBPJ and FOXO3 proteins could be functionally annotated to novel function or regulations based on our PPI studies: RBPJ might be regulated by DNA methylation-mediated transcriptional repression ( Supplementary Fig S4A [this file] ), and FOXO3 is potentially involved in BRCA1 signalling in DNA damage response ( Supplementary Fig S4B [this file] ).",tif,Proteomic analyses reveal distinct chromatin-associated and soluble transcription factor complexes,XML,,,,,,,

RNA-seq revealed that was induced after iPSC-differentiation to monocytes (d15), but lost again in macrophages (d21) (Fig. 1c, d [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM3] - 3 [rid=MOESM5] ), and that isoform NR_164153.1 (NR_164153.1) was predominantly expressed in monocytes (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). was one of the top altered lncRNAs expressed in monocytes compared to iPSC or macrophages (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] ). 
The successful knockout was validated by PCR with primers against the deleted genomic region and Sanger sequencing (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] , Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ), with RT-qPCR on cDNA level (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] ) and did not affect Anxa4 protein levels or splicing of (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). An additional RNA-seq and Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin (ATAC-seq) of knockout and non-targeting control (NTC) THP-1 cells revealed loss of expression accompanied by a loss of accessible chromatin of the deleted region (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
RNA immunoprecipitation in THP-1 and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) with antibodies against RUNX1 demonstrated that interacted with RUNX1, but not with the IgG negative control or in HEK293T cells (Fig. 2g [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
This strategy led to a knockout of RUNX1 on protein level, while the knockout itself had no effect (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 5a, b [this file] ). To determine the differential gene expression profile of and RUNX1 knockout THP-1 cells, RNA-seq was performed (Fig. 3c–f [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 7 [rid=MOESM9] , Supplementary Data 8 [this file0] ). 
CUT&RUN followed by high-resolution mapping of DNA binding sites affected by knockout showed that more than the majority of RUNX1-binding sites was decreased: 653 unaffected RUNX1-binding sites between control and knockout were found, but 801 RUNX1-binding sites decreased in knockout cells (Fig. 3i [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 9 [this file1] ). The -dependent alteration in RUNX1-DNA binding sites identified 66 genes in total that also exhibited differential expression in our RNA-seq analysis (Fig. 3l [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 7 [rid=MOESM9] , Supplementary Data 9 [this file1] ). The motif results for the common and downregulated RUNX1 peaks showed that the RUNX motif was the top hit in each of the peaksets, although there is a difference in the percentage of peaks with the motif between the common and downregulated groups (common >60% of the peaks have the motif, and downregulated >30%) (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ). 
Interestingly, overexpression of the Alu-element of in knockout THP-1 cells rescued the expression of and (Fig. 4h, i [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 6c [this file] ). 
Therefore, or RUNX1 knockout THP-1 were differentiated into osteoclast-like cells under the constant stimulation of RANKL and M-CSF (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ), which was followed by RNA-seq (Supplementary Data 10 [this file2] , Supplementary Data 11 [this file3] ). Before sequencing, osteoclast markers , , and were tested with RT-qPCR and were significantly increased in osteoclast-like cells compared to basal THP-1 (Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] ). Expression levels of many ossification marker genes were increased in knockout compared to control and RUNX1 knockout (Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] ). However, the overlap of differentially expressed genes in and RUNX1 knockout THP-1-differentiated osteoclasts was limited (Supplementary Fig. 7d–g [this file] , Supplementary Data 10 [this file2] , Supplementary Data 11 [this file3] ).",pdf,RUNX1 interacts with lncRNA SMANTIS to regulate monocytic cell functions,XML,,,,,,,

Notably, infection with pathogenic SC5314 yeast cells (5 × 10 CFUs) continuously yielded high tissue fungal burdens during the course of experiments (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ), evidence on disease causality. Moreover, histopathologic examination of Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections from -infected mice confirmed abundant tissue colonization of aggregate yeast cells with no pseudohyphae and filaments, however, showed less severe inflammation and tissue damage and had much smaller multifocal areas of abscess formation than did -infected mice (Supplementary Fig. 1d–f [this file] ). 
Longer incubation periods ( ., 24 h) were not considered in this study, since we observed robust cell death in BMDMs 24 h after co-incubation (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). When yeast-form cells of or were inactivated by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA-killed) and treated with BMDMs, we also found that was able to stimulate higher levels of cytokine/chemokine gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ), minimizing a possible effect of hyphal induction during co-culture. 
Principal component analysis (PCA) performed on accurately normalized data showed that mapped RNA-seq reads of both PBS and were clustered together, with minor variations between the biological replicates, whereas reads of exhibited major variance, as a clear separation from PBS and was observed (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ), suggesting that the host response of was very similar to that of PBS but significantly separated from that of . By contrast, treating BMDMs with C. significantly increased the number of DEGs, with 201 and 884 genes at the 3 and 6 h time points, respectively (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs (Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM6] and 4 [rid=MOESM7] ) showed that the host response specific for stimulation includes genes related to chemokine, Th17, Toll-like receptor, JAK-STAT, NF-κB, and MAPK signaling pathways, whereas it is not the case for the response to (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). This tendency became even more obvious when we compared changes in the expression of selected innate immune-related genes during the interaction of BMDMs with PBS, or s (Fig. 1f [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] ). 
Interestingly, we observed peak levels of phosphorylated ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPKs in BMDMs after co-culture with live cells for 15 min (Fig. 1g [rid=Fig1] ), and at this time, the cells were still uniformly yeast-form (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ), downplaying the influence of hyphal formation on host MAPK activation. 
Interestingly, no statistically significant difference was observed in adhesion between skin-derived HaCat and gut-derived Caco-2 (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ), and an in vitro infection model using the commercial three-dimensional reconstructed epidermis-EpiSkin also verified the weak adherence ability of (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c [this file] ). However, in vivo model of murine skin, topical exposure revealed that established persistent colonization on the skin surface (Supplementary Fig. 5d, e [this file] ). Moreover, we found that unlike , failed to be endocytosed by Caco-2 cells (Supplementary Fig. 5f, g [this file] , Supplementary Movies 1 [rid=MOESM9] , 2 [this file0] ) and some other epithelial or endothelial cells (Supplementary Movies 3 [this file1] – 10 [this file8] ). Second, we investigated host-pathogen interactions by examining the abilities of different immune cells, including macrophages and neutrophils from humans and mice, to phagocytose and kill yeast cells in vitro. or cells were co-cultured over time with mouse BMDMs and primary human monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs), respectively, and initial recognition by macrophages was investigated by live video microscopy (Supplementary Movies 11 [this file9] – 14 [rid=MOESM22] ). In both human and mouse macrophages, showed reduced rates of uptake compared to (Fig. 2f, g [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ) and the phagocytic index of was also less than that of after 30 and 60 min of co-culture (Fig. 2f, h [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 6a, c [this file] ). Similar results were observed for PFA-killed yeast-form cells of both strains (Supplementary Fig. 6d–f [this file] ). Compared to , appeared to be taken up and internalized by neutrophils at lower rates (Fig. 2i–k [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 6g–i [this file] ). Importantly, the weaker interaction between and innate immune cells correlated with stronger resistance to intracellular killing by phagocytic cells (Fig. 2l, m [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 6j, k [this file] ). Indeed, further analysis using fluorescent microscopy proved that compared to , caused a small, but significant fall in the percentage of uptake (Supplementary Fig. 6l [this file] ) and phagocytic index (Supplementary Fig. 6m [this file] ), as well as less damage to the phagocytes like BMDMs (Fig. 2n [rid=Fig2] ). 
We further evaluated innate immune responses using the mouse model described above (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). It has to be noted that different inoculum doses of (5 × 10 CFU/mice) and (1 × 10 CFU/mice) were used, largely because of the fact that mice inoculated with at 1 × 10 CFU experience a clinical illness manifested by ruffled fur, reduced activity and weight loss, and rapidly reach the humane endpoints (within 5 days) (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). It has to be noted that all mice infected with cells survived and appeared to be clinically normal, although we did observe abnormal symptoms, including slight weight loss, head bobbing and body spinning, in mice receiving a high inoculum (2 × 10 CFU/mice) (Supplementary Fig. 7b, c [this file] ). Consistent with the results in Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , we observed in Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] that following inoculation, the fungal burden was fairly constant and high on day 2 and 5 post-inoculations, regardless of inoculum size. 
Consistently, we found that the distribution of innate immune cells (e.g., leukocytes, CD11b cells, macrophages, monocytes, and NK cells) mirrored the patterns described for neutrophils, is particularly present in significantly higher numbers in -infected tissues versus -infected tissues (Fig. 3d, e [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 8b, c [this file] ). In terms of tissue fungal burden, there was no significant difference between and (Supplementary Fig. 8d [this file] ). However, we noticed that serum levels of cytokines/chemokines were significantly higher in -infected mice than in -inoculated mice (Supplementary Fig. 8e [this file] ) (the data on day 5 were unavailable because most mice reach the humane endpoint and have to be sacrificed before that time), minimizing the possible effect of inoculum size on innate immune activation. 
Our in vitro assays using different mammalian cells showed that all three cell types of displayed no differences in cell adherence (Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] ) and macrophage cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. 9b [this file] ). Moreover, all three cell types of also failed to induce p38 MAPK activation (Supplementary Fig. 9c [this file] ) and cytokine production (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 9d [this file] ). Consistently, when mice were challenged with either Y or FC form of in two different inoculum sizes, we observed that neither low (10 CFU/mice; L) nor high (2 × 10 CFU/mice; H) dose inoculum shows significant differences in fungal loads (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f [this file] ), innate immune cell populations (Fig. 4b, c [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 9g, h [this file] ) and cytokine production (Fig. 4d [rid=Fig4] ), highly suggesting that innate immune evasion of appears to be morphology-independent. 
Among them, 14 strains were isolated in different geographical areas, including 4 from China (Cau-C #1–2, Clade I; Cau-C#3–4, Clade III), 2 from Japan (Cau-J #1–2, Clade II), 6 from India (Cau-I #1–4, Clade I; Cau-I #5-6, Clade III), 1 from Korea (Cau-K, Clade II), 1 from South America (Cau-S, Clade IV), and 2 strains were independently isolated following repeated serial passage of the parental strain BJCA001 in fluconazole-containing medium (BJCA001-R #1–2) (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). Fluconazole resistance in each strain was assessed by a checkerboard assay according to the respective minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the drug (Supplementary Fig. 10a [this file] ). Similar to BJCA001, the rest of strains also failed to elicit meaningful proinflammatory response in BMDMs (MOI = 5; 3 or 6 h), as evidenced by unaltered p38 MAPK phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 10b [this file] ) and decreased expression and secretion of cytokines/chemokines (Fig. 4e, f [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 10c, d [this file] ). Similar results were obtained in experiments with lower doses of inoculum (MOI = 0.1) and longer time in stimulation (24 h) (Fig. 4g [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 10e [this file] ). 
The results are summarized in Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] . 
Notably, the HPLC elution profiles of the two strains were identical (Supplementary Fig. 12 [this file] ) and no additional distinct peaks were present between the two HPLC chromatograms, suggesting that should have no alternative PAMPs which may differ considerably from . The changes in cell wall polysaccharide fractions in and were further confirmed by both fluorescent staining and flow cytometry (Fig. 5f [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 13a [this file] ). A similar exposure pattern was observed during host-pathogen interaction (Supplementary Fig. 13b [this file] ). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 13c [this file] , same patterns of β-glucan exposure were shown in both staining methods. Confirmation of acid-labile mannan (phosphomannan) deficiency was observed by the reduced Alcian blue staining (Supplementary Fig. 13d [this file] ). 
Consistent with previous findings , the Δ/Δ mutant strain had a complete loss of phosphomannan (Supplementary Fig. 13e [this file] ) and displayed a significant reduction in macrophage uptake (Supplementary Fig. 13f [this file] ). Surprisingly, this mutant was still able to induce at least the same or even higher cytokine production when compared to the wild-type (Supplementary Fig. 13g [this file] ). Furthermore, we also found that deletion had no effect on pathogenicity because the Δ/Δ mutant was equally virulent in mice compared to its wild-type counterpart (Supplementary Fig. 13h [this file] ) . 
To further validate the essential role of the outer mannan layer of cell wall in protection against innate immune responses, we focused on various mannan-binding receptors in host, including the mannose receptor (MR), Mincle, DC-SIGN, TLR4, and TLR2. stimulation induced higher expression levels of these receptor-encoding genes in BMDMs than did (Supplementary Fig. 14a [this file] ). Moreover, blockade of Mincle or DC-SIGN in BMDMs, by using specific antibodies, resulted in unexpected cytokine responses seen either increasing or decreasing expression of cytokines in response to depending on the type of cytokine and blocking antibody tested (Supplementary Fig. 14b, c [this file] ). 
In , glycosylation of cell wall mannoproteins involves activities of a number of enzymes, for example, the families of fungal-specific mannosyltransferases (Supplementary Fig. 15a [this file] ). Searching the genome database for the number of genes encoding mannosyltransferases identified 51 in and 49 in , respectively (Supplementary Fig. 15b [this file] , Supplementary Data 5 [rid=MOESM8] ). Further RT-qPCR analyses indicated that the transcript levels of genes encoding the major protein - and - mannosyltransferases were significantly increased in when compared to their levels in (Supplementary Fig. 15c [this file] ), which may explain the observed phenotype that has an extensive outer mannan layer. 
Searching the released genome sequence of identified a gene orthologue encoding the protein product that shares 76.6% sequence similarity with Pmr1 of (Supplementary Fig. 16a [this file] ). In vitro analysis showed that Δ mutant of displayed significant vegetative growth defects, formed large aggregates and maintained yeast forms (Supplementary Fig. 16b–e [this file] ). Furthermore, similar to its counterpart in , the deletion mutant of also exhibited a weakened cell wall, exemplified by increased sensitivity to cell wall- and cell membrane-damaging agents such as Calcofluor White (CFW), Congo Red and SDS (Supplementary Fig. 16f [this file] ), and activation of the cell wall integrity pathway (Supplementary Fig. 16g [this file] ), suggesting that this gene is the functional ortholog of . 
belongs to one of the family members encoding a protein -mannosyltransferase catalyzing the initial step of protein -glycosylation (Supplementary Fig. 15a [this file] ) . Pmt1 shares a 55.2% sequence similarity with its orthologue Pmt1 (Supplementary Fig. 17a [this file] ). In vitro assays revealed that Δ mutant of had similar growth phenotypes as Δ mutant (Supplementary Fig. 17b–d [this file] ). Similar to Δ/Δ mutant of , Δ mutant of did exhibit growth and morphology defects in cell wall- and cell membrane-damaging agents (Supplementary Fig. 17e [this file] ), as well as activation of the cell wall integrity pathway (Supplementary Fig. 17f [this file] ). 
In yeast fungi like , -mannan outer chain synthesis is initiated by the α-(1,6)-mannosyltransferase encoded by whose protein product shares 76.6% sequence similarity with Och1 of (Supplementary Fig. 18a [this file] ). We, therefore, generated a Tetoff- mutant in which the endogenous promoter in BJCA001 was replaced with the tetracycline-regulatable promoter (Supplementary Fig. 18b, c [this file] ). When mutant cells were cultured with doxycycline, growth was unaffected on standard YPD medium (Supplementary Fig. 18d [this file] ) but the mannan content at the cell surface was remarkably decreased, based on fluorescent staining and flow cytometry (Supplementary Fig. 18e [this file] ), reconfirming the conserved function of Och1 in the elaboration of the outer mannan chains. More importantly, growth in 5 μg/ml doxycycline, which is sufficient to significantly reduce the expression of (Supplementary Fig. 18c [this file] ), significantly stimulated the production of cytokines (TNFα) by BMDMs (Supplementary Fig. 18f [this file] ), suggesting that protein glycosylation in the outer layer of cell wall also plays a key role in suppressing the innate immune response.

Although the percentage of small pre B cells in bone marrow from mice was less than that in WT mice, total cell number and frequency of peripheral B cells were not changed in mice (Supplementary Fig. 1a [this file] ). Similarly, no significant effect of deletion, starting at early hematopoiesis in mice, on the generation of B cell subsets was found (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). 
In the absence of immunization, the basal serum level of IgG1 was lower than, whereas the concentrations of IgM, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 in mice were similar to mice (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). Correlated with these data, we also observed a decrease in the number of PCs in non-immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] ). Meanwhile, NP-specific plasmablasts and NP-specific IgM, IgG2b, IgG3 ASCs were also significantly less in NP-LPS immunized mice in comparison with mice (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). On the other hand, immunization with NP-Ficoll, by which IgG3 is the dominant IgG form in antibody response, induced similar amounts of NP-specific IgG3 in and mice (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ), suggesting that p38α in B cells was not involved in type II T cell-independent immune response. Consistently, PC generation was significantly decreased by knockout in mice after NP-LPS immunization (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ) but was comparable in NP-Ficoll-immunized mice (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ). 
Naïve B cells isolated from mice, which had a better deletion efficiency in naive B cells than mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ) were used for the cellular experiments. To examine the involvement of other p38 family members in PCs generation, we cultured naïve B cells from , or mice in the iPC differentiation system, and found that iPCs generation from those mutant B cells was comparable to their WT counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] to 3d [this file] ). The genetic knockout of , or in naïve B cells was evidenced by sequencing of p38 isoforms in their corresponding mutation cells (Supplementary Fig. 3e [this file] ). 
The requirement of p38α in PC generation was also examined under several other in vitro culture conditions, including BAFF + CD40L + IL-4, BAFF + CD40L + IL-21, and anti-IgM+IL-4, and iPCs generation from B cells was severely impaired under all those conditions (Supplementary Fig. 3f [this file] ). We also examined the effect of deletion on B cell activation induced by various stimuli, including IL-4, anti-CD40, anti-IgM, and anti-IgM+IL-4, and found no difference (Supplementary Fig. 3g [this file] ). 
Pattern of CFSE dilution was similar in CD19 CD138 and CD19 CD138 cells (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ), and total B cell number at day 4 or day 8 showed no significant difference between and WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ), indicating that cellular proliferation during iPC differentiation was not altered by deletion. 
We next analyzed the stability of mRNA by treating cells with actinomycin D to block synthesis of new mRNA and found the half-life of mRNA was comparable in cultured and WT B cells (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). Treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 and protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide had no effects on BLIMP1 protein stability and translation, respectively, in and WT iPC culture (Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] and 4e [this file] ). 
Differentially expressed genes were classified into 8 groups by whether their expression in iPCs can be restored by ectopic expression of p38α and/or BLIMP1 (Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). The Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that the genes in Group 5 were mainly enriched in the processes of cell proliferation and activation (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). Since no significant difference in cell division or activation was observed in cultured B cells (Supplementary Fig. 3g [this file] , 4a [this file] and 4b [this file] ), we did not further evaluate this group of genes. 
Retroviruses encoding each sgRNA (BFP ) were produced individually and utilized to transduce B cells from mice (GFP ), followed by analysis of the percentage of iPCs among sgRNA-expressing cells (GFP BFP ) (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] ). was used as a positive control for this system, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] , sgRNAs targeting dramatically decreased p38α expression and iPCs generation, consistent with results from mouse genetic studies (Fig. 2a [rid=Fig2] ). 
Moreover, ectopic expression of TCF3, TCF4 and IRF4 partially restored BLIMP1 expression (indicated by GFP expression) in B cells (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ) and IgG1 and IgE secretion in B cells (Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] ), suggesting that p38α controls BLIMP1 expression and antibody secretion via TCF3, TCF4, and IRF4. 
It needs to note that deletion did not affect the protein levels of TCF3 and TCF4 and slightly decreased the IRF4 protein level (Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] and 7d [this file] ). This notion is also supported by the observation of the decrease of IRF4 protein level in B cells in iPC culture (Supplementary Fig. 7e [this file] ). 
We showed that knockout by CRISPR/Cas9 in cultured B cells in iPC differentiation system had no markable effect on B cell number, different from knockout that significantly decreased B cell number (Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). Ectopic expression of MEF2C, or its phospho-mimetic mutants MEF2C-3E (T293E/T300E/S387E) or MEF2C-3D (T293D/T300D/S387D) in cultured B cells had no rescue effect on knockout caused defect in iPC differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 8b [this file] ). Moreover, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of in both and WT iGCB cells decreased PC differentiation in the iPC differentiation system, suggesting additive effects of MEF2C and p38α in this process (Supplementary Fig. 8c [this file] ). 
However, ectopic expression of a E47 S140D or S140E phosphomimetic mutant in cultured B cells restored iPC differentiation to a degree similar to WT TCF3 (Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] ), suggesting that phosphorylation of Ser140 is dispensable for the function of E47 in iPC generation. 
These reporters could also signpost transactivation of TCF3/TCF4 and IRF4 in the in vitro iPC differentiation system (Supplementary Fig. 9b [this file] ). Co-expression of IRF4 with IRF4 reporter enhanced reporter gene expression and activation of p38α dramatically enhanced IRF4-dependent reporter expression (Supplementary Fig. 9c [this file] ). We mutated each of the potential phosphorylation sites in IRF4 (Supplementary Fig. 9d [this file] ) and expressed them in the co-expression assay. T267A, T268A and T269A mutation, but not the mutation on other sites rendered IRF4 no long response to p38α in increasing IRF4 reporter gene expression (Fig. 7b [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 9e [this file] ) and the triple T to A mutant (T267A/T268A/T269A) of IRF4 completely lost the transcription activity. 
As mentioned before, p38α was required for NP-LPS-induced PC generation in vivo (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ), we therefore investigated whether the p38α-BLIMP1 axis was also involved in this process. 
Here, we show that p38α controls PC differentiation by upregulating transcription via TCF3, TCF4, and IRF4. p38α can directly activate IRF4 by phosphorylating it on T267, T268, and T269 (Supplementary Fig. 9d [this file] ). 
However, S140D or S140E mutant had no difference from WT TCF3 (E47) in restoring iPC differentiation of cultured B cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] ), indicating that the previously described regulation mechanism of TCF3 (E47) by p38α is not applicable to iPC differentiation. 
In agreement with the data of chimeric mice, our studies showed that deletion does not affect B cell development, activation and division (Supplementary Fig. 1a [this file] and 1b [this file] , Supplementary Figs. 3g [this file] , 4a [this file] and 4b [this file] ). We showed in this study that the effect of knockout on B cell survival was different from that of knockout (Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] ). MEF2C, or its phospho-mimetic mutants cannot rescue the defect in iPC differentiation caused by knockout (Supplementary Fig. 8b [this file] ). And the effect of knockout and knockout had additive effect in impairing iPC differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 8c [this file] ). 
We showed that deletion of and did not affect iPC differentiation (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] and 3d [this file] ).

Figures S1–S14,local-data,mmc1,No description,Document  S1.  Figures  S1–S14,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"Over 18 months, we collected fresh BrM specimens and matched blood samples from 31 patients at Emory University Hospital who underwent surgical resection of at least one BrM ( Figure S1 [this file] A). Samples were obtained fresh at time of surgery and included a mixture of primary tumor types, the most abundant of which was lung carcinoma ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] A and S1 [this file] A), consistent with it being the primary cancer most likely to metastasize to the brain. [xref] [rid=bib43] [xref] [rid=bib44] All patients were naive to immunotherapy. 
See also Figure S1 [this file] . 
BrMs were variably infiltrated by immune cells, ranging from 2.9 × 10 to 2 × 10 CD45 lymphocytes per gram of tumor (median 7.6 × 10 ), with BrMs from breast cancer having the lowest infiltration density ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] B and S1 [this file] B). CD8 T cell infiltration was also variable (range of 3.4 × 10 to 1.5 × 10 , median of 2.0 × 10 CD8 T cells/gram of tumor), with breast-carcinoma histology again showing the lowest density of infiltration ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] C and S1 [this file] C). Just under 10% of tumor-infiltrating CD4 T cells expressed FOXP3 by flow cytometry across measured samples ( Figure S1 [this file] D). 
The response to PD-1 pathway blockade and other immunotherapies is primarily mediated by CD8 T cells, and proliferation of these cells is associated with positive clinical outcomes after ICB. [xref] [rid=bib10] [xref] [rid=bib45] To interrogate the phenotype of circulating and tumor-infiltrating CD8 T cells in patients with BrMs, we performed high-parameter flow cytometry on patient-matched tumor-infiltrating and circulating CD8 T cells ( Figure S2 [this file] A). 
CD127 and CD28 have been used as extracellular markers of TCF-1 progenitor CD8 T cells in chronic infections and cancer. [xref] [rid=bib18] [xref] [rid=bib27] [xref] [rid=bib35] In BrM-infiltrating CD8 T cells, CD28 and CD127 were both more frequent on PD-1 TCF-1 compared with PD-1 TCF-1 cells ( Figures S2 [this file] B and S2C), but their expression did not completely recapitulate that of TCF-1. CD127 was mostly absent from PD-1 TCF-1 cells but only expressed on half of PD-1 TCF-1 cells ( Figure S2 [this file] B). CD28 was a more sensitive marker of TCF-1 expression and was found on over 75% of TCF-1 cells but lacked specificity, with expression on over 50% of TCF-1 cells ( Figure S2 [this file] B). 
Most cells in cluster 5 also expressed TOX and were TCF-1 ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] E and S2 [this file] D). 
See also Figure S2 [this file] . 
To determine transcriptional profiles, interrogate differentiation pathways, and examine antigen specificity of these PD-1-expressing cells, we performed scRNA-seq with TCR sequencing on sorted PD-1 CD8 T cells isolated from three non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) BrMs and two melanoma BrMs immediately after surgical resection ( Figure S3 [this file] ). There was no difference in the percentage of cells in each metacluster between BrMs from lung cancer versus melanoma, suggesting that these two tissues of origin did not strongly influence the phenotype of BrM-infiltrating PD-1 CD8 T cells here ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] C and 3D), consistent with our flow-cytometry results ( Figure S2 [this file] E). 
See also Figures S3 [this file] and S4 [this file] . 
Tumor-infiltrating PD-1 CD8 T cells in the A and D metaclusters had a terminally differentiated phenotype similar to that of FlowSOM cluster 5 that was characterized by high expression of genes encoding co-inhibitory molecules such as , (CD39), (TIM-3), and , consistent with this population containing tumor-reactive cells ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] E, 3F, and S4 [this file] A). These cells expressed a unique repertoire of genes encoding cell-surface proteins that could be assessed for co-inhibitory or co-stimulatory potential ( Figure S4 [this file] D). Metaclusters B and C expressed the lowest levels of co-inhibitory markers ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] E, 3F, and S4 [this file] ). They were distinguished from each other by higher expression of tissue-residence genes, such as CD69, in metacluster C ( Figure S4 [this file] A). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) revealed that the transitory transcriptional signature characterized in the murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) model of CD8 T cell exhaustion [xref] [rid=bib19] was enriched in the D metacluster, suggesting that these cells may be undergoing differentiation from stem-like to terminally differentiated PD-1 CD8 T cells ( Figure S4 [this file] B). Similar analysis showed that the LCMV terminally differentiated signature was enriched in metacluster A ( Figure S4 [this file] B). 
To determine the clonal relationship between circulating and BrM-infiltrating CD8 T cells, we performed TCR sequencing on non-naïve PD-1 and PD-1 CD8 T cells sorted from patient-matched peripheral blood ( Figure S3 [this file] ). 
(F and G) Four other patients are shown in Figure S6 [this file] . 
See also Figure S5 [this file] . 
However, these dividing and exhausted cells exhibited minimal TCR overlap with metaclusters B and C, which contained cells with a less- or non-exhausted phenotype ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] E and S5 [this file] ). Most CD8 T cell clones—and particularly the most abundant clones—within each patient’s tumor were mostly restricted to either an exhausted (metaclusters A/D) or progenitor-like (metaclusters B/C) phenotype ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] F, 4G, and S5 [this file] ), indicating that these populations have largely unshared antigen specificity. 
Previous studies have identified tumor-infiltrating bystander CD8 T cells, [xref] [rid=bib40] [xref] [rid=bib50] but little is known about bystander infiltration of BrMs. We queried the VDJdb, a database of TCRs with known specificity, [xref] [rid=bib51] for matches with TCRs from our scRNA-seq data and identified one CMV-specific TCR in each of two patients ( Figure S6 [this file] ). We stimulated these cells with a microbial peptide pool (CEFX), isolated interferon gamma (IFNγ) and IFNγ CD8 T cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS), and performed TCR sequencing on each subset to identify TCRs that responded to CEFX stimulation with cytokine secretion and were thus microbe specific ( Figure 5 [rid=fig5] A and S7 [this file] A). 
See also Figures S6 [this file] and S7 [this file] . 
Phenotypically, CEFX-specific BrM-infiltrating PD-1 CD8 T cells were found within metaclusters B/C in all four patients, where they were significantly enriched ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] B–5D and S7 [this file] B). Importantly, some of these experimentally validated bystander cells had a transcriptional phenotype similar to tumor-specific progenitor PD-1 CD8 T cells characterized in other studies, [xref] [rid=bib35] marked by expression of (CD127), , and (TCF-1) ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] G and S7 [this file] C). 
To test this, we performed spatial transcriptomics, a method to measure gene expression , on six BrM tissue sections: one melanoma ( Figure 6 [rid=fig6] ), one renal cell carcinoma ( Figure S8 [this file] ), one breast carcinoma ( Figure S9 [this file] ), and three lung carcinomas ( Figures S10–S12 [this file] ). 
See also Figures S8–S14 [this file] . 
Tumor parenchyma—referring to regions of tumor cells—was readily differentiated by their gene expression profiles ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] A, 6B, and S8–S12 [this file] ). For sections where tumor-normal boundaries were clearly demarcated, the number of differentially expressed genes between tumor parenchyma and surrounding stroma ranged from 3,914 to 7,480 ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] F, S11 [this file] C, and S12 [this file] E). In the two samples where tumor parenchyma and stroma were intermixed, the numbers of differentially expressed genes between the two regions were 637 and 2,327 ( Figures S8 [this file] E and S9 [this file] E). One of the six tissue sections was composed entirely of tumor parenchyma, precluding this analysis ( Figures S10 [this file] A–S10C). 
In the renal cell carcinoma case, “small nests” of tumors showed a higher density of , , and expression than “large nests,” and these transcript levels were even higher in regions of desmoplasia surrounding vessels ( Figures S8 [this file] C and S8D). Additionally, in the two lung-carcinoma samples where tumor parenchyma and brain tissue were visible, transcript levels were highest at the tumor interface with brain ( Figures S11 [this file] D, S12 [this file] C, and S12D). 
See also Figure S10 [this file] . 
These findings were confirmed in the lung carcinoma BrM (patient 15), where the entire tissue section was tumor parenchyma and was inhabited only by TCRs expressed by metacluster A/D cells ( Figures S10 [this file] E–S10J). 
In the renal cell carcinoma sample (patient 24), gene expression varied with tumor architecture: 305 genes were differentially expressed between small and large nests of tumor ( Figures S8 [this file] F–S8H). Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression was higher within small tumor nests compared with large tumor nests ( Figure S8 [this file] F), suggesting that CD8 T cells within the same tumor may receive different levels of TCR stimulation based on their location within the parenchyma. Conversely, in the breast carcinoma sample (patient 24), MHC class I was highly downregulated in capture spots containing tumor, potentially indicating limited tumor-associated antigen presentation to CD8 T cells in this patient ( Figure S9 [this file] G). 
Differences in cytokine and chemokine expression between bulk tumor parenchyma and surrounding tissue were also striking ( Figure S13 [this file] A). As examples, (encoding TGF-β) was enriched in the stroma in three samples, whereas its receptor was more highly expressed predominately in the parenchyma ( Figures S13 [this file] A and S13B). The IFNγ receptor subunit was elevated in the parenchyma of four of five tumors ( Figures S13 [this file] A and S13C). and were upregulated in the parenchyma all five tumors ( Figures S13 [this file] A and S13D). To catalog signaling networks between specific regions of the BrM microenvironment, we used CellPhoneDB [xref] [rid=bib52] to interrogate expression of receptor-ligand pairs between among spatial-transcriptomics clusters ( Figure S14 [this file] ). This analysis revealed several signaling molecules involved in multiple signaling pathways within the BrM microenvironment, including vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), VEGF-B, TGF-β, galectin-9, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and others ( Figures S14 [this file] A–S14D). Confirming the observations above, CellphoneDB analysis showed that tumor-surrounding inflammatory stroma expressed and , with its corresponding receptors found in the tumor parenchyma of patient 16 ( Figure S14 [this file] E). In patient 24, where gene expression varied by tumor histology ( Figure S10 [this file] ), TGF-β signaling also varied within different tumor regions ( Figure S14 [this file] F). Certain galectin-9 signaling pathways also varied between tumor regions ( Figures S14 [this file] E and S14F). Additionally, the commonality of some of these signaling pathways across different patients ( Figures S14 [this file] A–S14D) within our cohort indicates the presence of targetable signaling pathways across BrMs of different primary histologies. 
The duration of dexamethasone therapy prior to surgery was not correlated with CD45 lymphocyte or CD8 T cell infiltration of brain metastases in our cohort ( Figures S1 [this file] E and S1F). 
Cells were then stained for viability, CD3, and CD8 and sorted on a BD FACS ARIA II in the Emory University School of Medicine Flow Cytometry Core ( Figure S7 [this file] A). 
For analyses of boundary and tumor gene expression ( Figure S13 [this file] ) the following clusters were used: sample 16, clusters 5 and 3/4 (boundary and tumor, respectively); sample 19, clusters 3 and 5; sample 24, clusters 4 and 1/2/3; sample 26, clusters 6 and 1/2/3; sample 27, clusters 7 and 2/3/4/5/6.",pdf,Distinct phenotypic states and spatial distribution of CD8,XML,,,,,,,

Sample characteristics of the immunogenicity cohort (n = 51) are provided in[this file] . 
The Proteome Discoverer (v1.3, Thermo Fisher) was used to integrate the search results of the SequestHT search engine (University of Washington) ( 30 [rid=B30] ) against the human proteome (Swiss-Prot database, 20 279 reviewed protein sequences, September 27th 2013) accompanied with recurrent somatic CLL-associated mutations in 61 different proteins ([this file] ) as described in the literature ( 31 [rid=B31] , 32 [rid=B32] ) and assigned in the COSMIC database ( ) ( 33 [rid=B33] ) without enzymatic restriction. 
In the first step of our workflow for the definition of an off-the-shelf peptide warehouse ([rid=f1] ), we comprehensively mapped the immunopeptidome of 61 primary CLL samples (n = 52 for HLA class I, n = 49 for HLA class II,[this file] ). The number of identified unique peptides per patient ranged from 527 to 9 530 (mean 3 035,[this file] ). For HLA class II, we identified 70 525 different peptides (range 575-10 392, mean 3 842 per sample,[this file] ) derived from 6 074 source proteins, achieving 85% of maximum attainable coverage ([this file] ). 
In comparison, 76% of patients included in a previous CLL peptide vaccination trial ( NCT02802943 (NCT02802943) ), 68% of the European population, and 61% of the world population carry one or more of these HLA allotypes ([this file] ). Allotype-specific immunopeptidome analysis revealed 8 575 unique HLA-A*02- (range 82-3 723, mean 1 121 per sample), 5 280 unique HLA-A*24- (range 134-1 926, mean 1 042 per sample), and 5 780 unique HLA-B*07-restricted (range 223-2 933, mean 1 140 per sample) peptides derived from 5 020, 3 813, and 3 886 source proteins, achieving 89%, 85%, and 86% of the estimated maximum attainable protein coverage, respectively ([this file] ). Overlap analysis of the total HLA class I immunopeptidome of the CLL cohort with the benign tissue cohort revealed 23 676 peptides to be exclusively presented on CLL samples and never on benign tissue samples ([this file] ). Allotype-specific overlap analysis with the entirety of benign tissue-derived immunopeptidomes revealed 2 774 HLA-A*02-, 1 440 HLA-A*24-, and 1 450 HLA-B*07-presented peptides detected exclusively on CLL samples ([rid=f1] and[this file] ). At a target-definition FDR of < 1%, a total of 393 HLA-A*02-, 168 HLA-A*24-, and 127 HLA-B*07-restricted ligands with allotype-specific representation frequencies up to 73%, 81%, and 60%, respectively, and 3 970 HLA class II-restricted peptides with frequencies up to 59% were identified ([rid=f1] and[this file] ). 
In addition to the identification of high-frequent non-mutated tumor-associated peptides, we screened our CLL cohort for naturally presented neoepitopes derived from common CLL-associated point and frameshift mutations (95 point and 3 frameshift mutations within 61 different genes representing 85 different mutation sites,[this file] ). 
For the setup of a broadly applicable peptide warehouse, we focused on the 532 non-mutated peptides presented by ≥ 20% of (HLA-matched) CLL samples comprising 82 HLA-A*02-, 105 HLA-A*24-, 127 HLA-B*07-, and 218 HLA class II-restricted peptides ([this file] ). 
Experimentally acquired spectra of the selected peptide identifications were validated by comparison of mass spectrometric fragment spectra using isotope-labeled synthetic peptides ([rid=f2] and[this file] ). 
Using aAPC-based priming of naive CD8 T cells of HLA-matched HVs, we confirmed induction of peptide-specific CD8 T cells for all 9 HLA class I peptides in at least 2/3 HVs ([rid=f3] ,[this file] and[rid=T1] ). Intracellular cytokine and degranulation marker staining revealed induction of multifunctional peptide-specific T cells for 7/9 (78%) peptides ([rid=f3] ,[this file] and[rid=T1] ). Moreover, IFN-γ ELISpot assays, using PBMCs from HLA-matched CLL patients, revealed preexisting peptide-specific memory T cells targeting 2/9 (22%) and 4/5 (80%) HLA class I- and HLA class II-restricted warehouse peptides in up to 29% and 50% of CLL patient samples, respectively ([rid=f3] ,[this file] and[rid=T1] ).

DNase-seq libraries were generated from 50 million cells and sequenced on Illumina instruments ( supplementary table S1 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). 
Details on the number of reads in the input files and at each step are included in supplementary table S2 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online. 
Because some of the samples were from males and some were from females ( supplementary table S1 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online), we removed reads that mapped or lifted over to the human X or Y chromosomes to eliminate any sex-specific bias. Details on the number of reads lifted over and remaining after removal of sex chromosomes are included in supplementary table S2 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online.

Five contrasts were used to identify changes in a single species, six for changes in two species, and four for changes in three species ( Supplementary files 2 [this file] , supplementary table S4 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). 
We have included Supplementary Material [this file] online that contain the input data for the R script ( Supplementary files 3 [this file] ), the results from the analyses discussed in this article ( Supplementary files 4 [this file] ), and the field information for the input and output files ( Supplementary files 5 [this file] ). The GitHub repository contains a document (also included as Supplementary files 6 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online) detailing the necessary modifications to that script.

We then tested for significant enrichment of positive selection in different classes of DHS sites ( supplementary table S5 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). 
We then tested whether the distributions of differed between classes of differential DHS sites ( supplementary table S6 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). 
We then asked whether the distribution of cell type specificity scores varied between different classes of DHS sites ( supplementary table S7 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online).

S1 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). Because we are drawing on the original data from Shibata et al. (2012) [rid=evz218-B51] for three species (human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque) and new data generated several years later for two species (gorilla and orangutan) ( supplementary table S1 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online), we also investigated whether batch effects would overwhelm the species signal by comparing principal component analyses performed with and without three additional chimpanzee samples generated more recently and reported in Pizzollo et al. (2018) [rid=evz218-B38] ( supplementary table S1 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). As shown in supplementary figure S1 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online, the Pizzollo et al. chimpanzee samples cluster with the original Shibata et al. chimpanzee samples across the first four principal components (cumulative proportion of variance of 0.53), suggesting that biological signal is retained even when samples are prepared and sequenced years apart.

Using the species-specific calls from Shibata et al., we detected a high degree of concordance ( supplementary table S8 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). Due to updates in the analysis pipeline, not all of the DHS sites that were previously characterized were also identified as DHS sites in this study ( supplementary table S9 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). For 342 DHS sites that Shibata et al. characterized as human-specific increased accessibility, 245 (72%) are still characterized as human-specific increased accessibility even after including gorilla and orangutan, whereas 91 (27%) are now characterized as increased accessibility in human and at least one other species ( supplementary table S8 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). For 148 DHS sites that Shibata et al. characterized as human-specific decreased accessibility, 21 (14%) are still characterized as human-specific decreased accessibility even after including orangutan and gorilla, whereas 107 (72%) are now characterized as decreased accessibility in human and at least one other species ( supplementary table S8 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). A similar trend was detected for previously identified chimpanzee-specific changes ( supplementary table S8 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). For 1,154 DHS sites that Shibata et al. (2012) [rid=evz218-B51] characterized as nondifferential between human, chimpanzee, and rhesus macaque, 5% (56) displayed changes in accessibility on the gorilla and/or orangutan branches that were not considered by Shibata et al., ( supplementary table S8 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). 
For DHS sites that are not differential between primate species, 22% (11,850) of these regions overlap proximal elements, 57% (30,371) overlap distal elements, and the remaining 20% (10,857) are unannotated ( fig. 5 [rid=evz218-F5] and supplementary table S10 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). All DHS sites with increased accessibility relative to rhesus macaque display a substantially depleted amount of proximal element overlap compared with the nondifferential DHS sites (human: 3%; chimpanzee: 4%; gorilla: 9%; orangutan: 10%; human–chimpanzee: 3%; human–chimpanzee–gorilla: 5%; fig. 5 [rid=evz218-F5] and supplementary table S10 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). Conversely, half of the classes of DHS sites with decreased accessibility relative to rhesus macaque overlap proximal elements to a similar degree as nondifferential DHS sites (human: 19%; chimpanzee: 22%; gorilla: 12%; orangutan: 21%; human–chimpanzee: 35%; human–chimpanzee–gorilla: 11%; fig. 5 [rid=evz218-F5] and supplementary table S10 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online). 
DHS sites with increased accessibility in chimpanzee, gorilla, or orangutan all have much higher overlaps with unannotated regions, with orangutan increased accessibility showing the highest degree of overlap with unannotated regions ( fig. 5 [rid=evz218-F5] and supplementary table S10 [this file] , Supplementary Material [this file] online).

In C6-treated cells, however, WDR5 is absent from fractions above 670 kDa ( Figures 1B [rid=F1] and S1B [this file] ), with most material migrating below the 158-kDa marker. The impact of C6 on complex formation is an authentic consequence of WIN site blockade, because mutation of phenylalanine 133 within the WIN site (F133A) has a comparable impact on the distribution of WDR5 ( Figures S1C [this file] and S1D [this file] ). Supporting this point, an inactivating mutation in the WBM site (L240K), which disrupts interaction with both RBBP5 and KMT2A/B ( Figure 1C [rid=F1] ), has little effect on WDR5 mobility in these gradients ( Figures S1C [this file] and S1D [this file] ). 
We treated lysates from “heavy” and “light” HEK293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged WDR5, recovered proteins by FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP), and analyzed samples by MudPIT liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) ( Figure 2A [rid=F2] ; Figure S2A [this file] ). The experiment was performed in duplicate, with label swap, and a total of 747 proteins were quantified in the IP samples ( Figures S2B [this file] and S2C [this file] ; Table S1 [rid=SD2] ). 
As predicted from experiments in Figure 1 [rid=F1] , most canonical WDR5 interaction partners are recalcitrant to WIN site inhibition, including members of KMT2 and NSL complexes ( Figure 2D [rid=F2] ; Figure S2D [this file] ; Table S2 [this file] ). These same themes are reinforced by results of Reactome pathway and ontology analyses ( Figures S2E [this file] and S2F [this file] ). 
We confirmed that interaction of FLAG-tagged WDR5 with PDPK1, RICTR, SIN1, HELB, SYRC, SYIC, and MTMR1 is sensitive to C6 ( Figure 3E [rid=F3] ) and to mutation of the WIN site of WDR5 ( Figures S3A [this file] and S3B [this file] ). 
Now, WDR5 associates with all four mTORC2 components in a manner that is sensitive to C6 ( Figure 3F [rid=F3] ) and the F133A mutation ( Figure S3C [this file] ). 
Interestingly, we also observed that all three interact with WDR5 in a manner that is sensitive to mutation of the WBM site, and that two, CHD8 and UBR5, contain WBM motifs ( Figure S3D [this file] ). 
We confirmed by coIP that endogenous PDPK1 and WDR5 interact in multiple cell lines ( Figure 4A [rid=F4] ; Figure S4A [this file] ), and that the interaction in U2OS cells is sensitive to C6, as determined by proximity ligation assay ( Figure 4B [rid=F4] ; Figure S4B [this file] ). We demonstrated that the interaction is unaffected by treatment of cells with the PDPK1 kinase inhibitor GSK2334470 ( Najafov et al., 2011 [rid=R51] : Figure 4C [rid=F4] ) and, conversely, that its disruption by C6 has no obvious effect on growth factor signaling by PDPK1, including AKT and S6 kinase phosphorylation ( Figure S4C [this file] ). 
We inhibited CRM1-dependent nuclear export with leptomycin B (LMB) and quantified the distribution of wild-type (WT) and R3A EGFP-tagged PDPK1 variants in U2OS cells ( Figures S4D [this file] – S4F [this file] ). 
We confirmed that a PDPK1 N-terminal peptide lacking the initiator methionine binds to recombinant WDR5 ( Figure S5A [this file] ). We also purified endogenous PDPK1 from HEK293 cells ( Figure S5B [this file] ), analyzed AspN digestion products by MS/MS ( Figure S5C [this file] ), and saw that all spectra assigned to the N terminus of PDPK1 carry two modifications; they lack the initiator methionine and carry an amino-terminal acetyl moiety ( Figure 5A [rid=F5] ). 
Ectopic N-terminal acetylation has been shown to increase the affinity of H3 and KMT2A WIN motif peptides for WDR5 ( Avdic et al., 2011b [rid=R5] ; Karatas et al., 2010 [rid=R31] ), and we observe this phenomenon with H3 peptides in our TR-FRET (time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assays ( Figure S5D [this file] ). 
Next, we determined the X-ray crystal structure of WDR5 in complex with an acetylated PDPK1 peptide ( Figures 5C [rid=F5] – 5F [rid=F5] ; Table S3 [this file] ). In general, the WDR5-PDPK1 WIN peptide interaction resembles other WDR5-WIN peptide structures ( Figure S5E [this file] ), with residues A2 and R3 of PDPK1 making contacts with WDR5 deep in the WIN site ( Figure S5F [this file] ), and the guanidinium side chain of R3 sandwiched by two aromatic rings from F133 and F263 of WDR5 ( Figure 5F [rid=F5] ). Like other WDR5-WIN peptide structures ( Zhang et al., 2012 [rid=R81] ), residues downstream of R3 lie along a crevice between blades three and four of the WDR5 b-propellor structure ( Figure 5C [rid=F5] ), and like other structures, the exact conformation of these residues is unique ( Figure S5E [this file] ). Distinct from other structures, the side chain of L8 of PDPK1 makes contact with side chains of F149 and Y191 of WDR5 ( Figure S5F [this file] ). 
Importantly, the acetyl group of the PDPK1 peptide forms an intramolecular interaction whereby the carbonyl of the acetyl group makes a hydrogen bond to the amide of T4 ( Figure S5G [this file] ). 
Interestingly, the human proteome contains 67 proteins with potential WIN motifs ( Figure S5H [this file] ; Table S4 [this file] ), including PDPK1, 19 histone H3 variants, and HELB, one of the proteins that is displaced from WDR5 with the WIN site inhibitor. Large-scale proteomic mapping of N-terminal acetylation ( Lange et al., 2014 [rid=R35] ; Yeom et al., 2017 [rid=R80] ) has not detected this modification in any of the proteins in Figure S5H [this file] , with exception of a small percentage of H3, perhaps because trypsin (which cleaves after arginine residues) generates WIN fragments that are too small for robust detection. 
We created U2OS cells in which endogenous PDPK1 or WDR5 are tagged with an FKBP12(F36V)-2xHA cassette ( Figures S6A [this file] and S6B [this file] ), permitting their degradation via the small molecule dTAG47 ( Huang et al., 2017 [rid=R29] ; Nabet et al., 2018 [rid=R50] : Figures S6C [this file] and S6D [this file] ). For both proteins, depletion is stable over 6 days, and cell growth over this time is slowed ( Figures S6E [this file] and S6F [this file] ). Importantly, neither tag disrupts the PDPK1-WDR5 interaction by coIP ( Figures S6G [this file] and S6H [this file] ). We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) after 24 h of dTAG47 treatment and found that PDPK1 depletion results in changes in the expression of ~1,100 genes ( Figures 6A [rid=F6] and 6B [rid=F6] ; Figure S6I [this file] ). WDR5 depletion has more extensive effects, leading to changes in expression of ~7,400 genes ( Figures 6C [rid=F6] and 6D [rid=F6] ; Figure S6J [this file] ). The overlap of significant gene expression changes between the two is ~660 ( Figure S6K [this file] ). For PDPK1 and WDR5 depletion, Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified transcript changes consistent with the known functions of both proteins ( Figures 6E [rid=F6] and 6F [rid=F6] ; Figures S6L [this file] and S6M [this file] ). In general, changes in expression of these 246 genes are small ( Figures 6K [rid=F6] ; Figure S6N [this file] ) but significant ( Figures S6O [this file] and S6P [this file] ). 
To ask if any of these gene expression changes are due to disruption of the WDR5-PDPK1 interaction, we introduced the R3A mutation into endogenous loci in HEK293 cells ( Figures S7A [this file] and S7B [this file] ). Unfortunately, mutation of the N terminus of endogenous PDPK1 is accompanied by a decrease in PDPK1 expression ( Figure S7A [this file] ), preventing comparison of the R3A and WT parental cell lines. Compared with the WT PDPK1 reconstitution, we identified 429 significantly changed transcripts for vector cells and 136 significantly changed transcripts for R3A PDPK1 cells ( Figures S7C [this file] and S7D [this file] ), 110 of which overlap ( Figure 7B [rid=F7] ). 
Degradation of WDR5 and PDPK1 leads to changes in cell-cycle distribution that could produce changes in cell-cycle gene expression ( Figures S7E [this file] – S7G [this file] ). To separate cause from effect, we arrested cells in G1 with palbociclib ( Fry et al., 2004 [rid=R19] ) or G2 with RO-3306 ( Vassilev et al., 2006 [rid=R74] ; Figure S7H [this file] ) and examined the impact of WDR5 degradation on the expression of a set of G2/M-induced genes. Here, we observed that transcript levels from the G2/M genes are unaffected by WDR5 depletion in G1-arrested cells but are induced by WDR5 depletion in the G2 arrested state ( Figure S7I [this file] ). 
Ninety-two of these common genes ( Table S5 [this file] ) show reduced expression in response to PDPK1 depletion ( Figures S7J [this file] and S7K [this file] ), and 27 are also induced by the R3A mutation in PDPK1 ( Figure 7H [rid=F7] ).

Indeed, we found progressive accumulation of the BRCA1-BARD1 complex on chromatin during S phase mirroring H4K20me0 incorporation 6 [rid=R6] ( Fig. 2a [rid=F2] ; Supplementary Fig. 2a, b [this file] ), and this was dependent on H4K20me0 recognition by the BARD1 ARD ( Fig. 2b [rid=F2] ; Supplementary Fig. 2c, d, e [this file] ). Depletion of SET8, responsible for methylation of H4K20 in G2 and mitosis, increased H4K20me0 levels and augmented BRCA1-BARD1 binding to chromatin in G2 and G1 in a manner dependent on H4K20me0 recognition by the BARD1 ARD ( Fig. 2d [rid=F2] ; Supplementary Fig. 2f, g, h [this file] ). 
Wild-type (WT) BARD1 recruitment to ionizing irradiation (IR)-induced DSBs increased during S phase and reached a maximum in late S before dropping in G2/M ( Fig. 3a [rid=F3] ), mirroring H4K20me0 occupancy 6 [rid=R6] ( Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ) and recruitment of other HR factors 11 [rid=R11] , 19 [rid=R19] . Of note, BARD1 WT and ARD mutants were expressed at similar levels across the cell cycle and were proficient for BRCA1 stabilization via the RING domain dimerization 3 [rid=R3] ( Supplementary Fig. 2c, e [this file] ). Further, we found that ARD recognition of H4K20me0 was as important as RNF8-dependent ubiquitination 14 [rid=R14] for BRCA1 accumulation at DSBs ( Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ), indicating that BRCA1-BARD1 recruitment requires multivalent interactions with chromatin at DSBs, similar to 53BP1 20 [rid=R20] . 
BRCA1 foci dominated in mid and late S phase in the presence of BARD1 WT as expected 11 [rid=R11] , but, remarkably, this pattern was reversed by the BARD1 ARD mutant ( Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). 
Consistent with a role of the H4K20me0 recognition in antagonizing 53BP1, depletion of 53BP1 partly restored HR in cells expressing the ARD mutant ( Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). Moreover, mutation of the H4K20me0 recognition site was as detrimental to HR as deletion of the full ARD or BRCT domain previously shown to be essential for HR 22 [rid=R22] ( Fig. 4b [rid=F4] , Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ), underscoring that the essential function of the ARD in HR is H4K20me0 recognition. In these experiments we included mouse BARD1 as a control and found that it rescued HR activity ( Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ) although N470, predicted to bind H4K20me0 ( Fig. 1b [rid=F1] ), is not conserved in mice. The best scoring structures predicted a repositioning of H4 R17, reducing the contacts between the H4 tail and BARD1 N470 as compared to N571 in TONSL ( Supplementary Fig. 4a, b [this file] ). All other interactions were highly similar between the two reader domains, in particular the contacts between BARD1 E467 and D500 with H4 H18 and the contacts between BARD1 E429, D458 and E467 with H4 K20 were conserved ( Supplementary Fig. 4a, b [this file] ). Consistent with this binding model, residues E467 and D500, but not N470, were critical for BARD1 chromatin binding and recruitment to IR-induced DSBs ( Supplementary Fig. 4c, d [this file] ). These key acidic residues diverge from the consensus ankyrin repeat 17 [rid=R17] , but are conserved across species in BARD1, TONSL and SLF1 ( Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ), explaining specialization of these ARDs for H4K20me0 recognition. 
The full proteomics list for H4K20me0/me2 nucleosome pull-downs is presented in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] .

Despite the differences in genetic background (Kras vs. KP), several ncPRC1.6 complex repressed germ cell related transcripts, including , were highly upregulated in KP cells lacking MGA ( Figure 2D [rid=fig2] , Supplementary file 1b [this file] ), similar to Kras-sgMga tumors. 
MGA, MAX, E2F6, and L3MBTL2 were seen to bind several thousand promoters in MGA-expressing KP tumor cells suggesting that the PRC1.6 complex plays a broad role in tumor cell gene expression ( Supplementary file 1c [this file] ). 
As for mouse KP lines, we observed a overall decrease in MGA and L3MBTL2 binding in inactivated cells (termed sgMGA), including at STAG3 and promoters ( Figure 5—figure supplement 1A [rid=fig5s1] ; Supplementary file 1d [this file] ).

Importantly, this analysis also confirmed that the only site co-bound by both TALEs is the promoter ( Figure S1 [this file] E). Notably, TINC did not simply result in the detection of highly abundant chromatin-associated proteins, but also in the specific enrichment of lowly abundant candidates, which further supports the validity and sensitivity of TINC ( Figure S1 [this file] G). 
See also Figure S2 [this file] and Table S3 [rid=mmc4] . 
The TINC proteins included 56 TFs and 101 epigenetic modifiers ( Figure S2 [this file] A; Table S1 [rid=mmc2] ). While the epigenetic modifiers were mainly associated with histone modifications ( Figure S2 [this file] B), the TFs showed enrichment for various processes related to transcriptional regulation and maintenance of pluripotency ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] D). Intersection of the TINC proteins with the previously defined pluripotency regulatory network ( Nefzger et al., 2017 [rid=bib47] ; Xu et al. 2013 [rid=bib68] , 2014 [rid=bib67] ) revealed that 69 key network components form part of the regulatory complex ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] E and S2 [this file] C). 
Interestingly, while we identified 381 of the authors' small interfering RNA targets at the promoter, knockdown (KD) of only 23 resulted in a significant decrease in expression, indicative of a role of these proteins in maintenance of pluripotency ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] F, S2 [this file] D, and S2E). Conversely, KD of 14 TINC proteins resulted in a significant increase in expression, suggesting that these proteins act as repressors of and might play a role in silencing of this gene during differentiation ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] F, S2 [this file] D, and S2E). 
See also Figure S3 [this file] . 
To determine whether these proteins directly control expression, we used small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) for which we obtained approximately 75% target KD ( Figures S3 [this file] A and S3B). Depletion of several of these factors resulted in a change in ESC morphology, which was most pronounced for and ( Figure S3 [this file] C). As shown previously, KD of led to a considerable amount of cell death ( Chen et al.,2012 [rid=bib11] ), while loss of triggered the cells to grow in a monolayer instead of dome-shaped colonies ( Figure S3 [this file] C). 
Analysis of TINC protein expression during MEF reprogramming revealed that many are transiently or permanently upregulated and that these proteins are mainly associated with chromatin organization and transcriptional regulation ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] D, S3 [this file] D, and S3E). Furthermore, 73% of the TINC proteins, including the majority of our candidates, are upregulated at the end of reprogramming and are strongly correlated with expression ( Figures 3 [rid=fig3] E, 3F, and S3 [this file] D). 
Using a different reprogramming system (OKMS instead of OKSM) and two alternative shRNAs individually and combined, we observed the same trend ( Figures S3 [this file] F and S3G). Flow cytometric analysis during reprogramming revealed that the total number of cells en route to becoming iPSCs (SSEA1+) approximately doubled due to an overall increase in cell numbers rather than an increase in the percentage of SSEA1+ cells ( Figures S3 [this file] H–S3J). Conversely, overexpression of led to a decrease in iPSC formation, although non-significant, which indicates that RCOR2 may impair pluripotency acquisition ( Figure S3 [this file] K). 
To gain further insight into the targets and partners of RCOR2, we first performed ChIP-seq, which revealed extensive binding to intergenic and intronic regions in ESCs ( Figure S4 [this file] A; Table S4 [rid=mmc5] ). Approximately 13% of the binding sites of RCOR2 are located in promoter regions, including the promoters of , , and ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] A and S4 [this file] A). Indeed, the majority of RCOR2 target genes are expressed (e.g., 8,514) and associated with various cell division- and pluripotency-related functions, while low or unexpressed targets (e.g., 3,030) are mainly associated with neuronal processes ( Figure S4 [this file] B). Intersection of the genome-wide binding sites and target genes of RCOR2 revealed extensive co-occupancy of RCOR2 with NANOG, OCT4, or SOX2 targets ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] B and S4 [this file] C; Table S4 [rid=mmc5] ). Notably, genes occupied by all four factors have the highest median expression, include many key pluripotency regulators, and are enriched for various developmental processes ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] B, 4C, S4 [this file] D). In line with the observed binding of RCOR2 to neuronal genes ( Figure S4 [this file] B), we obtained motif enrichment for REST, a repressor associated with silencing of neuronal genes in non-neuronal cells ( Chong et al., 1995 [rid=bib13] ; Schoenherr and Anderson 1995 [rid=bib56] ). 
See also Figure S4 [this file] and Table S4 [rid=mmc5] . 
Among those were 79 transcriptional regulators predominantly associated with histone modifications, including LSD1, which had previously been found to interact with RCOR2 in pluripotent and neural cells ( Yang et al., 2011 [rid=bib69] ; Wang et al., 2016 [rid=bib64] ) ( Figure S4 [this file] E; Table S4 [rid=mmc5] ). Furthermore, integration of published ChIP-seq data confirmed extensive co-binding of RCOR2 and LSD1 within ESCs ( Figures S4 [this file] F and S4G; Table S4 [rid=mmc5] ). Interestingly, while some of these sites are also bound by REST and CoREST or, to a larger extent by NuRD complex components, many sites are exclusively targeted by LSD1 and RCOR2 ( Figures S4 [this file] F and S4G). Notably, ESC enhancers did not show major occupancy by CoREST or REST but extensive targeting by LSD1, RCOR2, and NuRD members ( Figure S4 [this file] H). Importantly, concomitant inhibition of LSD1 alleviated the inhibitory effect of RCOR2 overexpression, suggesting that RCOR2 exerts its function at least partly via LSD1 during reprogramming ( Figure S3 [this file] K) Together, our results revealed that RCOR2 binds extensively in ESCs and forms part of various regulatory complexes, including, LSD1, NuRD, and CoREST/REST complexes. 
To further investigate the role of RCOR2, we created a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout (KO) ESC line ( Figure 5 [rid=fig5] A). depletion was confirmed at the DNA, RNA, and protein levels ( Figures S5 [this file] A–S5C). Notably, KO resulted in similar morphological changes as observed upon shRNA-mediated KD ( Figures S3 [this file] C and 5 [rid=fig5] A). Interestingly, many RCOR2 targets, which showed transcriptional deregulation upon KO were related to cell cycle and cell division ( Figure S5 [this file] D). In agreement, growth rate analyses revealed a significant decrease in ESC and MEF doubling time upon depletion, suggesting that RCOR2 is a negative regulator of cell-cycle progression ( Figure S5 [this file] E). Furthermore, this analysis revealed that RCOR2 is involved in transcriptional regulation of various pluripotency network components, including repression of and ( Figures 5 [rid=fig5] C and S5 [this file] F).

In agreement with the EB assay, teratoma assays showed limited growth for KO ESCs Although KO ESCs were able to eventually form teratomas with cell types from all three germ layers, it took an additional 5 days to reach a palpable size ( Figures S5 [this file] G–S5H).",pdf,TINC— A Method to Dissect Regulatory Complexes at Single-Locus Resolution— Reveals an Extensive Protein Complex at the,XML,,,,,,,

See also Figure S4 [rid=mmc1] and Table S4 [this file] . 
Next, to determine interactors of RCOR2, we conducted co-immunoprecipitations (CoIPs), which identified 368 proteins ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] E and 4F; Table S4 [this file] ). Among those were 79 transcriptional regulators predominantly associated with histone modifications, including LSD1, which had previously been found to interact with RCOR2 in pluripotent and neural cells ( Yang et al., 2011 [rid=bib69] ; Wang et al., 2016 [rid=bib64] ) ( Figure S4 [rid=mmc1] E; Table S4 [this file] ).

In addition, the phosphorylation of AKT, FOXO1 and GSK3β was markedly suppressed by cold exposure in liver, suggesting that cold exposure showed coordinated effects on BAT (elevated glucose uptake) and liver (increased gluconeogenesis) glucose metabolism (Fig. 1j [rid=Fig1] and Supplemental Figure S1b [this file] ). Meanwhile, decreased gluconeogenic gene expression levels (Fig. 1o [rid=Fig1] ), along with increased phosphorylation of AKT, FOXO1 and GSK3β was observed in the liver upon cold exposure (Fig. 1p [rid=Fig1] and Supplemental Figure S1c [this file] ). 
Although 72 h of cold exposure robustly activated the thermogenic activity of iBAT (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] ), its weight was not markedly changed yet (~100 mg, Supplementary Figure S2a [this file] ). As revealed by nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), the collected BDEVs amount gradually increased within 24 h and reached a plateau in both the control (RT-BAT) and cold exposed (Cold-BAT) group, thus, a 24 h incubation period was chosen for further studies (Supplementary Figure S2b [this file] ). Of note, the Cold-BAT generally displayed more EV secretion than RT-BAT (4 × 10 RT-BDEV particles, ~80 μg RT-BDEV protein; while 1 × 10 Cold-BDEV particles, ~160 μg Cold-BDEV protein collected at 24 h, respectively) (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] c, d and Supplementary Figure S2c [this file] ). However, its detection in the same quantify of RT-BDEV samples was limited (Supplemental Figure S2e [this file] ). More importantly, the protein levels of EV markers, including CD9, CD63 and ALIX were markedly increased in cold-activated BDEVs compared with EVs isolated from the same amount of control BAT (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] and Supplemental Figure S2d [this file] ). As indicated by the red fluorescence staining of the hepatocytes, fluorescent signals could be detected in hepatocytes as early as 2 h post incubation, and gradually increased and reached a plateau phase after 6 h of incubation, which exhibited efficient uptake of BDEVs (Fig. 2g [rid=Fig2] and Supplemental Figure S2f [this file] ). Notably, the appearance of GFP signals in the liver suggested that cold exposure resulted in significantly increased BDEV uptake by the hepatocytes (CK18-positive, red) compared to RT (Fig. 2k [rid=Fig2] and Supplemental Figure S3a [this file] ). The GFP mRNA was not detected in the liver of mice infected with Palm-GFP lentivirus (Supplementary Figure S3b [this file] ). Moreover, neither the fluorescent signal nor mRNA expression was detected in the liver infected with Ctrl-EGFP, indicating that it is unlikely that the GFP signal detected in the liver was due to viral leakage (Supplementary Figure S2g [this file] - S2i [this file] ). Although the fluorescent GFP signals were highly expressed in the liver, the signals could also be detected in the kidney, heart, white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle but not the brain (arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, hippocampus and cortex) (Supplementary Figure S3c [this file] ). 
Since cold exposure significantly increased BDEVs secretion, for 24 h incubation, 4 × 10 RT-BDEV particles (~ 80 μg RT-BDEV protein) and 1 × 10 Cold-BDEV particles (~ 160 μg Cold-BDEV protein) were isolated from the medium from 100 mg RT-BAT and Cold-BAT after 24 h of incubation, respectively (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Figure S2c [this file] ). The BDEVs and hepatocytes were co-incubated for 48 h, followed by functional analysis (Supplementary Figure S4a [this file] ). Compared with the cells treated with 1.6 × 10 RT-BDEVs (~32 μg), the phosphorylation level of AKT was dramatically decreased in the hepatocytes administered 4 × 10 Cold-BDEVs (~64 μg), concurrent with markedly increased gluconeogenic genes ( , , ) (Supplementary Figure S4b [this file] - S4c [this file] ). To explore whether treatment with equal amounts of Cold-BDEV particles or protein would also have similar effects, hepatocytes were incubated with 1.6 × 10 Cold-BDEVs (equal particle numbers as RT-BDEVs, Supplementary Figure S4a [this file] - S4c [this file] ) or 32 μg Cold-BDEVs (equal amounts RT-BDEV proteins, Fig. 3a–d [rid=Fig3] ), respectively. Furthermore, for those mice treated with BDEVs secreted from the same amount (100 mg) of cultured RT-BAT (~4 × 10 RT-BDEVs) and Cold-BAT ( ~ 1 × 10 Cold-BDEVs), a more significantly enhancement of hepatic gluconeogenesis was observed in mice treated with Cold-BDEVs (Supplementary Figure S4d [this file] - S4f [this file] ). BAT local GW4869 treatment did not affect mouse food intake, insulin or glucagon levels (Supplementary Figure S5a [this file] - S5c [this file] ). As Cold-BDEVs fluorescent signals were also detected in WAT (Supplementary Figure S3c [this file] ), their influence on lipolysis were assessed. Compared with mice treated with RT-BDEVs, Cold-BDEV (80 μg each day) treatment resulted in elevated mRNA levels of fatty acid oxidation genes and , suggesting that Cold-BDEVs may also play a role in facilitating WAT lipolysis (Supplementary Figure S4g [this file] ). 
Notably, compared with the control group of mice, only miR-378a-3p was significantly upregulated in both BDEVs and serum EVs from cold-exposed mice, suggesting that miRNAs were selectively packaged in activated BDEVs and that the miRNAs may be selectively packaged in BDEVs under cold stress (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] f, g and Supplementary Figure S6a [this file] - S6c [this file] ). Cold exposure significantly increased the mRNA level in BAT, but decreased its expression in the liver, which was consistent with the transcription level of miR-378a-3p (Supplementary Figure S6d [this file] and Fig. 4i [rid=Fig4] ). Compared with the control group, the expression of was markedly repressed in the liver from cold-exposed mice (Supplementary Figure S6e [this file] ). Next, 80 μg RT-BDEVs (~0.49 fmol miR-378a /μg RT-BDEV) and Cold-BDEVs (~1.75 fmol miR-378a /μg Cold-BDEV) were intravenously administered to mice each day for 3 days (Supplementary Figure S6f [this file] ). In addition, local injection of GW4869 (inhibit EV release) in BAT led to significantly decreased miR-378a-3p level in the liver of cold exposed mice but not fasted mice (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] k, l, Supplementary Figure S6i [this file] - S6k [this file] ). The observed differences in cold-exposed and fasted mice were reasonable, as the increased miR-378a-3p expression was resulted from the elevated transcription of miR-378a in the liver from fasted mice (Supplementary Figure S6g [this file] - S6h [this file] ), whereas for cold-exposed mice, the increased miR-378a-3p was not from its own transcription activation in the liver (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] i, m). In addition, the expression of Dicer, which directly regulates miRNA maturation, was unchanged in the liver of cold-exposed mice (Supplementary Figure S6l [this file] - S6m [this file] ). Moreover, the uneven changes in several other miRNA expression levels in the cold-exposed liver, including miR-21, -192, and -223, suggested that the increased miR-378a-3p was unlikely due to the change of the miRNA processing proteins in the liver (Supplementary Figure S6n [this file] ). 
In control hepatocytes untreated with anti-miR-378a, Cold-BDEVs administration significantly reduced p110α protein level and markedly increased gluconeogenic gene expressions (~2-fold increase) (Supplementary Figure S7a [this file] - S7b [this file] ). While in those cells treated with anti-miR-378a (100 nM), comparable protein levels of p110α were detected in hepatocytes treated with or without Cold-BDEVs, suggesting that the function of miR-378a-3p that derived from Cold-BDEVs were completely abolished in hepatocytes (Supplementary Figure S7c [this file] ). Notably, only slight increases (~1.2-fold) expressions of gluconeogenic genes were observed (Supplementary Figure S7d [this file] ). 
The characterization of 378KO mice is shown in Supplementary Figure S8a [this file] - S8e [this file] . There were no overt differences in insulin and glucagon levels between the 378KO mice and the control animals (Supplementary Figure S8f [this file] - S8g [this file] ).

Figures S1–S11 and Tables S1–S5,local-data,mmc1,No description,Document  S1.  Figures  S1–S11  and  Tables  S1–S5,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"To limit chances of unspecific and weak binding, we set a threshold for the docking score of each compound corresponding to the docking score of the kinase pocket natural substrate, ATP ( Table S2 [this file] ). 
This yielded IC s in the low micromolar range ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] D and Table S3 [this file] ). 
Z4 blocked tunicamycin-induced degradation of mRNA compared to control treatment ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] F) while it had no effect in cells overexpressing a dominant-negative form of IRE1 ( Figure S1 [this file] A). 
Neither nor mRNA expression was significantly affected upon treatment with Z4 ( Figures S1 [this file] B–S1C). Moreover, eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 protein expression were not altered upon Z4 treatment ( Figure S1 [this file] D). 
Treatment of RADH87 cells with Z4 impacted on pathways such as immunity, circulatory system development, cell locomotion, and cell migration; all properties involved in tumor establishment ( angiogenesis) and tumor invasion ( metastasis) ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] G–1I and S2 [this file] ). We then compared the proteomes of Z4-treated cell lines to the same cell line overexpressing a truncated mutant form of IRE1 lacking an RNase domain known to blunt IRE1 activity [xref] [rid=bib26] ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] H and S2 [this file] ). We found that Z4 treatment systematically reduced cell migration ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] J, 1K, and S3 [this file] ). Interestingly, the primary lines RADH85 and RADH87 were the most impacted by Z4 ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] J, 1K, and S3 [this file] ). Cell viability at the point of maximal TMZ administration decreased by 1.5-fold in the presence of Z4 compared to control ( Figure 1 [rid=fig1] L), an effect recapitulated in primary RADH87 cells ( Figure S4 [this file] ). 
The IC of these molecules was determined by a fluorescence-quenched IRE1 RNA substrate probe ( Figure S5 [this file] ) and the values are shown on Figure 2 [rid=fig2] C. 
The high TEER and low paracellular permeability of LY ( Table S4 [this file] ) shows that the barrier stability of the model was maintained during the incubation with the compounds, confirming the absence of significant toxic effect. 
Figures S6 [this file] and S7 [this file] show that both enantiomers inhibit IRE1 activity. Based on their IC values ( Figures S6 [this file] and S7 [this file] ) as well as MST data (not shown), we determined that both enantiomers are able to bind to IRE1 in a competitive manner. 
Figures 3 [rid=fig3] C, 3D and S8 [this file] show that IRE1 phosphorylation is reduced under Z4 compounds treatments. As shown by their respective kinome phylogenetic trees ( Figure S9 [this file] ) at a concentration of 10 μM, both compounds demonstrated to have very little effect on other kinases with no more than 20% inhibition across the panel ( Table S5 [this file] ). 
No toxicity was detected in wild-type (WT) mice in any of the concentrations tested ( Figure S10 [this file] A). 
While Z4P treatment alone had no effect on tumor growth or mouse survival, co-treatment with TMZ significantly increased survival and decreased tumor growth ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] F and S10 [this file] B). In contrast, no tumor relapse was observed in the group of animals treated with both TMZ and Z4P ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] G, yellow curve); full panel of samples are presented at D20 and D182 in Figure S11 [this file] . 
The global ability of Z4 compounds to sensitize GB cells to TMZ ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] and S4 [this file] ) together with the ability of the Z4-family member, Z4P, to cross the BBB ( Table 1 [rid=tbl1] ) increased their clinical potential value, thus further justifying investigations in preclinical GB mouse models. , a clear attenuation of mRNA splicing in Z4P-treated tumors suggests the effective penetration of this drug in the brain.

Another miR SOD1‐b sequence also targeting human SOD1 showed similar effects, which are therefore not specific to the miR sequence (Supplemental Figure S2 [this file] ). 
To assess if AAV‐miR SOD1 could prevent astrocytic and microglial activation in the spinal cord, we measured the area of GFAP immunoreactivity and the number of Iba1‐positive microglial cells on lumbar sections at day 65, 100 and 140 (Supplemental Figure S3 [this file] a–d). 
There was no difference between groups in the level of astrocytic markers (Supplemental Figure S4 [this file] a), indicating that the amount of contaminating astrocyte‐derived material was very similar across conditions. However, we found an upregulation of microglial transcripts in the AAV‐miR SOD1 treated mice as compared to the control groups (Supplemental Figure S4 [this file] b). 
Notably, subunit‐encoding genes of the ionotropic glutamate receptor family such as (glutamate ionotropic receptor 1, AMPA1) and (glutamate ionotropic receptor delta type subunit 2) were significantly downregulated (Supplemental Figure S5 [this file] a, b). Similarly, the levels of the transcripts encoding the gamma‐aminobutyric acid (GABA) A receptor subunits γ1 and γ2 were significantly reduced in the AAV‐miR SOD1 treated condition (Supplemental Figure S5 [this file] c, d).

The IPA showed that the purified proteins were enriched in the RNA processing pathways which is consistent with the known role of the family of hnRNP proteins (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). 
Furthermore, the IPA of proteins co-purified with both the SETD2 fragments showed enrichment of pathways belonging to RNA processing much like what was observed for hnRNP L (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). 
Notably, the interaction with hnRNP L persisted without the Pol II interaction domain and in fact, increased upon RNase treatment (Fig. 2g [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 2b, c [this file] ). 
This fragment was nuclear, consistent with our previous characterization of the SETD2 NLS (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ) . 
MudPIT analysis of the purified complexes revealed that the fragment 1964–2263 interacts with hnRNP L (Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). To accurately define the region of interaction between SETD2 and hnRNP L, additional Halo-tagged fragments and sub-fragments of SETD2 were made as depicted in Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] and affinity-purified followed by MudPIT analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] , Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM4] ). The mass spectrometry data was confirmed by performing Halo purification of several SETD2 fragments followed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). 
These findings were also confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-hnRNP L antibody (Supplementary Fig. 3d [this file] ). 
Structural modeling of 2164–2213 stretch using Robetta and iTASSER did not reveal any striking sequence characteristic with most of the predicted structure consisting of coils (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b [this file] ). As anticipated, immunoblotting for RNA Pol II and anti-hnRNP L revealed that the SETD2-hnRNP L interaction was abolished without affecting the SETD2-Pol II interaction (Fig. 3h [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 4c, d [this file] ). 
The purification demonstrates that the RRM2 of hnRNP L alone is sufficient to interact with SETD2 (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b [this file] ). 
Hence, despite achieving a significant depletion of hnRNP L in cell extracts, a substantial amount of hnRNP L was still present in SETD2C purification (sihnRNP L) (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). Despite this, we found that not only did the binding of SETD2 with other splicing-related proteins persisted upon the depletion of hnRNP L, but strikingly, their binding increased relative to the purifications from extracts of scramble-siRNA (siScramble) treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , Supplementary Data 6 [rid=MOESM4] ). 
The RNA-seq data revealed a global perturbation in terms of transcription and AS changes upon SETD2 and hnRNP L depletion (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
SETD2 depletion caused a significant (FDR < 0.05, fold change >1.5) upregulation of 57 genes out of which more than half showed a similar trend of increased expression upon hnRNP L depletion (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] , Supplementary Data 7 [rid=MOESM4] ). Also, out of the 146 genes that were significantly downregulated upon SETD2 depletion, more than a quarter of those showed a decreased expression upon hnRNP L knockdown (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). Notably, 95.24% of the differentially expressed genes that are co-regulated by SETD2 and hnRNP L showed a similar trend, whereas only 4.76% showed an opposite trend of expression (Fig. 6c, d [rid=Fig6] , and Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). 
Analysis of the AS events showed a similar trend where out of the 1221 differential AS events upon SETD2 knockdown compared to a scrambled siRNA treated cells, 16% of the events showed a similar trend on hnRNP L depletion, and only 1.47% of the events showed opposite regulation (Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] , Supplementary Data 8 [rid=MOESM4] ). 
Indeed, the rescue of 293T cells with SETD2 FL led to an increase in the ratio as compared to the vector control (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). No change in splicing was observed upon expression of SETD2 FLΔSHI relative to the control (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
Clear enrichment of H3K36me3 was found on genes the splicing of which were downregulated upon SETD2 depletion, suggesting that high H3K36me3 promotes splicing (Supplementary Fig. 9a, b [this file] ). Also, genes that showed a decrease in splicing upon SETD2 and hnRNP L depletion had higher H3K36me3 levels as compared to the genes that showed increased splicing or exhibited opposite trends (Supplementary Fig. 9c, d [this file] ). Such a correlation was not observed when hnRNP L-regulated AS genes were analyzed (Supplementary Fig. 9e, f [this file] ). 
Despite comparable expression levels of the constructs, a clear difference was observed in the H3K36me3 level between the cells rescued with WT SETD2 and the SETD2 mutants lacking the SRI and the SHI domains (Fig. 7c, d [rid=Fig7] , and Supplementary Fig. 10a [this file] ). 
Also, the decrease in H3K36me3 does not occur specifically from those genes the splicing of which is co-regulated by SETD2 and hnRNP L as H3K36me3 pattern was similar in SETD2 FLΔSHI expressing cells to that observed in SETD2 FL expressing and WT cells (Supplementary Fig. 10b [this file] ). 
Notably, the purification of SETD2 from extracts depleted of hnRNP L revealed enrichment of hnRNP A1 (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). On the other hand, the enrichment of U2AF2 was reduced (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
A sequence alignment of the four hnRNP L RRMs did not reveal any striking pattern that would explain the specificity of RRM2, and not the other RRMs, in engaging SETD2 and hnRNP L (Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). 
On the other hand, IPA of the co-purified proteins with the SETD2 N-terminus revealed enrichment of splicing-related pathways (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). Also, purification of SETD2 from cell extracts depleted of hnRNP L revealed enrichment of other proteins involved in pre-mRNA splicing (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
The sequence of oligos is in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] .

A total of 1236 proteins were significantly enriched over the mock (log fold change >1 and Z-statistic >2) including SETD2 (Fig. 1g [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). 
Proteomic analysis revealed a significant enrichment over mock (log fold change >1 and Z-statistic >2) of 116 proteins with the N + catalytic domains and 398 proteins with the C-terminal fragment (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). Strikingly, not only was hnRNP L co-purified with SETD2C, but it was also the most abundant protein identified in the purification after the bait (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). 
To accurately define the region of interaction between SETD2 and hnRNP L, additional Halo-tagged fragments and sub-fragments of SETD2 were made as depicted in Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] and affinity-purified followed by MudPIT analysis (Supplementary Fig. 3b [rid=MOESM1] , Supplementary Data 3 [this file] ). 
To test whether the 2164–2213 portion of SETD2 when added to ySet2 could result in interaction with hnRNP L, the stretch was added to ySet2, and ySet2ΔSRI followed by affinity purification and MudPIT (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Data 4 [this file] ). 
To test this hypothesis, Halo-SETD2CΔSRI and Halo-SETD2CΔSHI, were affinity-purified and subjected to mass spectrometry (Supplementary Data 5 [this file] ). 
Despite this, we found that not only did the binding of SETD2 with other splicing-related proteins persisted upon the depletion of hnRNP L, but strikingly, their binding increased relative to the purifications from extracts of scramble-siRNA (siScramble) treated cells (Supplementary Fig. 6 [rid=MOESM1] , Supplementary Data 6 [this file] ).

Notably, in SETD2C purifications, hnRNP A1 was the second most abundant protein after the bait, and U2AF2 was also identified in MudPIT (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ).",zip,The methyltransferase SETD2 couples transcription and splicing by engaging mRNA processing factors through its SHI domain,XML,,,,,,,

Validation of the RNA sequencing data were performed by qRT-PCR analysis using a subset of differentially expressed genes (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] , Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
The largest proportion of significantly (>2-fold) upregulated genes belonged to the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) defined categories of carbohydrate metabolism (30.1%) and inorganic ion homeostasis (24.4%), while genes associated with lipid metabolism represented the largest downregulated group (29.7%) (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). 
In addition, other genes involved in inorganic ion homeostasis also showed altered expression (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Concordant with Cd -treatment, the pneumococcal proteome revealed 395 individual peaks, indicative of protein-Cd interactions, and comparatively higher Cd abundance across the cytoplasmic proteome (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Comparison of the Cd peaks with the Zn proteome showed overlapping spatial distribution of the peaks, suggesting that Cd ions were interacting with some of the fractions previously associated with Zn ions (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
We propose that the resultant depletion of cellular Zn can be attributed to Cd -bound AdcR mimicking the Zn -bound state leading to repression of the regulon consistent with the downregulation of the Zn -recruiting genes , , and , (Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
In addition, targeted metabolite analyses of Cd -treated cells revealed that cellular NADPH levels were approximately two-fold higher compared to untreated ( = 0.056), while ATP levels were significantly depleted (60%; < 0.0001) in these cells (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
We observed that grown in CDM-Gal had reduced growth by comparison with CDM-Glu (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
This occurred concomitantly with significant increases in the mixed acid fermentation end-products acetate (~15%, = 0.0002) and ethanol (~250%, = 0.0003) (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ).

Further, Trypan blue staining and Sytox Green (a nucleic dye penetrating dead cells while excluded by live cells) staining both showed that depletion of SIRT7 induced significant increase of cell death rate (Supplementary Fig. S1a, b [this file] ). Consistently, SIRT7 overexpression (Supplementary Fig. S1c [this file] ) alleviated the decrease of cell viability and DNA damage while partially compromised the cell death induced by IR-exposure (Supplementary Figs.

Periostin deficiency did not prevent the onset of facial eczema; it appeared around postnatal day 10 (P10) as it also did in the control mice ( Figures 3A [href=#F3] and S2 [href=this file] ).
(A) Macroscopic facial skin lesions of FADS/ mice and FADS/ mice at the indicated periods after birth (See also Figures S1 [href=this file] and S2 [href=this file] ).
We excluded the possibility that decreased scratch behavior was due to decreased motor activities because there was no difference in motor activities between FADS/ and FADS/ mice ( Figure S3 [href=this file] ).
(A) Scratching bouts in control/ mice (n = 6), control/ mice (n = 5), FADS/ mice (n = 12), and FADS/ mice (n = 12) at the indicated periods after birth. (B, C) Representative traces (left) and quantitative analysis (right) of spontaneous neuronal firing (B, See also Figure S4 [href=this file] ) and correlation between scratching bouts and neuronal firing (C) in 8-week-old FADS/ mice (n = 5) and FADS/ mice (n = 5).
We confirmed that recorded neurons were located in dorsal horn at comparable depths in FADS/ and FADS/ mice (FADS/ , 51.2 ± 3.2 μm; FADS/ 57.3 ± 2.8 μm, Figure S4 [href=this file] ).
We confirmed that the same treatment with CP4715 did not reduce motor activity ( Figure S5 [href=this file] ), excluding a possible sedative effect on the anti-itch actions of CP4715. Furthermore, neutralizing anti-periostin Ab (OC-20) significantly decreased scratching bouts in FADS/ mice as well ( Figure S6 [href=this file] ).
White arrows indicate epidermal cells with nuclear p65 expression (G). (I, J) Spontaneous firing of dorsal horn neurons (I) and scratching bouts (J) in 60 minutes after 10–14-week-old (I) (n = 5) or 4-week-old (vehicle, n = 8; CP4715, n = 10) (J) FADS/ mice were treated with single-shot administration of vehicle or CP4715 (30 mg/kg, see also Figures S5 [href=this file] and S6 [href=this file] ).
Moreover, as we previously showed, IL-31 expression was not increased in FADS mice and neither genetic disruption nor pharamacological inhibition of periostin changed IL-31 expression ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ). Since either genetic disruption or pharmacological inhibition of periostin downregulated recruiment of neutrophils, but not expression of CXCL10 ( Figure S7 [href=this file] ), it is unlikely in FADS mouse that the neutrophil-CXCL10-CXCR3 pathway is involved in promoting itching as previously suggested.
We in this study showed that genetic disruption of periostin did not prevent the onset, but the development, of skin inflammation ( Figures 3A [href=#F3] and S2 [href=this file] ), suggesting that genetic inhibition of periostin would be useful for ameliorating rather than preventing allergic skin inflammation.",docx,Periostin activates distinct modules of inflammation and itching downstream of the type 2 inflammation pathway - PMC,HTML,"(1.9MB, docx)",media p,/articles/instance/11486451/bin/NIHMS2026890-supplement-Suppl_figures_and_legend.docx,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

While control hearts consistently contained regenerated muscle and minimal fibrosis (Figures 1E, 1G [rid=F1] , S1E–H, S1M–S1P, and S1U [this file] ), hearts displayed myocardial deficits (Figures 1F [rid=F1] and S1I–S1L [this file] ) and prominent scar tissue where the ventricle was wounded (Figures 1H [rid=F1] and S1Q–S1U [this file] ). 
Because heat shocking animals induces DN-MAML expression not only in the endocardium, but also in vascular endothelial cells ( Figures S1C–S1D′ [this file] ), we evaluated injured and heat-shocked animals for coronary artery abnormalities ( Figure S2A–S2H′ [this file] ) and for evidence of surface bleeding ( Figure S2I–S2S [this file] ) to predict the likelihood that a vessel defect might contribute to the regenerative failures. 
Using a strict significance threshold (p < 0.0001), we identified 131 downregulated and 123 upregulated transcripts in Notch-suppressed hearts (Figures 2A [rid=F2] and S3A [this file] ; Table S1 [rid=SD2] ). Consistent with the non-regenerative nature of heat-shocked hearts ( Zhao et al., 2014 [rid=R57] ), gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis identified “mitosis,” “cell cycle,” and “chromosome segregation” categories as overrepresented in the downregulated gene cluster (Figures 2B [rid=F2] and S3B [this file] ). We surveyed the list of downregulated genes to identify secreted factors whose production relies on Notch signaling ( Figures S3A and S3C [this file] ; Table S1 [rid=SD2] ) and were intrigued to find transcripts encoding the secreted Wnt antagonists Wif1 and Notum1b (Figures 2C [rid=F2] , S3A, and S3C [this file] ; Table S1 [rid=SD2] ). 
In both cases, prominent staining was observed adjacent to the ventricular myocardium ( Figures 2H–2I′ [rid=F2] ) in what we confirmed to be endocardial cells through colocalization with a transgenic reporter ( Figures S4A–S4B″ [this file] ). In addition, we observed significant overlap between each Wnt antagonist and pan-cytokeratin+ (PCK+) epicardial cells both proximal ( Figures S4H–S4H″ and S4J–S4J″ [this file] ) and distal ( Figures S4I–S4I″ and S4K–S4K″ [this file] ) to the wound. Last, we learned that neither protein is co-expressed with collagen, type I, alpha 1 (Col1a1) ( Figures S4L–S4M″″ [this file] ), which marks wound fibroblasts ( González-Rosa et al., 2012 [rid=R11] ). 
We used qPCR to compare the relative expression levels of and between 5 dpa control and animals in two regions of the injured ventricle that contain proportionally more epicardium or endocardium ( Figure S5A [this file] ). We observed significant declines in and levels exclusively in the tissue adjacent to the wound ( Figures S5B and S5C [this file] ). Therefore, like global Notch pathway suppression ( Figures 2C and 2D [rid=F2] ), endocardial-specific Notch pathway inhibition also results in significant decreases in and levels ( Figures S5A–S5C [this file] ), which is likely confined to the endocardium of the heart. 
While one target, ( Alexander et al., 2014 [rid=R1] ), showed highly variable expression between replicates, the other two targets, ( Alexander et al., 2014 [rid=R1] ) and ( Nery et al., 2014 [rid=R39] ), were found to be significantly increased in injured hearts ( Figure S6A [this file] ), suggesting that endocardial Notch signaling functions to restrain Wnt signaling during heart regeneration. 
Injections of IWR or BIO into uninjured animals caused , , and levels to drop or increase, respectively, by approximately 50% ( Figure S6B [this file] ), which validates the use of these small molecules to modulate Wnt signaling during regeneration. 
While the majority of DMSO-treated (87.5%; Figures 4B, 4E [rid=F4] , S6C–F, S6O–S6R, and S6AA [this file] ) and Wnt-inhibited (IWR treated; 57%; Figures 4C, 4F [rid=F4] , S6G–S6J, S6S–S6V, and S6AA [this file] ) hearts contained regenerated segments of muscle with minimal fibrosis, 75% of those with augmented Wnt signaling (BIO treated; Figures 4D, 4G [rid=F4] , S6K–S6N, and S6W–S6AA [this file] ) failed to regenerate as evidenced by discontinuities in the myocardial wall ( Figure 5D [rid=F5] ) that were filled with fibrin and collagen ( Figure 4G [rid=F4] ). 
By contrast, Wnt hyperactivation reduced myocardial proliferation by 42% ( Figures 4H, 4H′, 4J, 4J′, and 4K [rid=F4] ), consistent with the lack of regeneration observed at 30 dpa (Figures 4D, 4G [rid=F4] , S6K–S6N, and S6W–S6AA [this file] ).

By 3 months of age, degenerative areas expanded significantly in all the male adrenals ( =3), leading to cortical thinning ( Fig. S1B [this file] ). These degenerative changes affected female adrenals to a much lesser degree (2/3 adrenals examined at 3 months displayed only a few abnormal cells) ( Fig. S1B [this file] ). zG expansion is a known consequence of the constitutive activation of β-catenin in the adrenal cortex ( Berthon et al., 2010 [rid=DMM050053C5] ; Pignatti et al., 2020 [rid=DMM050053C56] ). However, in adrenals, the zG was not expanded in either sex, as shown by immunostaining with the zG markers DAB2 and LEF1 ( Fig. S1C,D [this file] ). 
Levels of the glucocorticoid corticosterone and another steroid hormone precursor, 11-deoxycorticosterone, showed a mild decrease in female and increase in male mice, although none of these changes reached statistical significance ( Fig. S2 [this file] ). Analysis of the adrenocorticotropic hormone-responsive differentiation marker AKR1B7 ( Sahut-Barnola et al., 2000 [rid=DMM050053C60] ) showed loss of expression in subpopulations of cells of the inner cortex, which explains the absence of hormone overproduction despite the striking hyperplasia ( Fig. S1E [this file] ). Plasma levels of the androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) did not differ significantly among control and mice ( Fig. S2 [this file] ). 
As the animals aged, the diffuse hyperplasia and cortical thinning gave way to increased frequency of well-circumcised benign nodules and adenomas ( Fig. S3 [this file] ) (6/8 males and 6/8 females of 12 months). Importantly, 1/8 aging females had a well-differentiated adrenal carcinoma with capsular invasion ( Fig. S3 [this file] ). 
To further investigate its molecular underpinnings, we conducted mRNA sequencing and differential expression analysis of whole adrenals from control and mice of both sexes during puberty (at 4 weeks), a timepoint before the occurrence of male-specific degeneration of adrenals ( Fig. S4A [this file] ) [data available at NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus ( Barrett et al., 2013 [rid=DMM050053C3] ) with the accession number ]. Genes enriched in animals of both sexes compared to controls (corresponding to cluster 1 of the heatmap in Fig. S4B [this file] ) were related to β-catenin upregulation ( Fevr et al., 2007 [rid=DMM050053C22] ; Sansom et al., 2007 [rid=DMM050053C61] ) or targets of the β-catenin-associated transcription factor LEF1 ( Xie et al., 2005 [rid=DMM050053C70] ), a finding consistent with an hyperactivation of canonical WNT signaling by . Genes specifically upregulated in female adrenals (corresponding to cluster 3 of the heatmap in Fig. S4B [this file] ) were found to be primarily related to cell cycle regulation, DNA replication and repair, and cell division ( Fig. 2 [rid=DMM050053F2] B). On the contrary, genes highly expressed in male adrenals (corresponding to cluster 2 of the heatmap in Fig. S4B [this file] ) were associated with the regulation of the immune system and defense response ( Fig. 2 [rid=DMM050053F2] B). Moreover, an unbiased comparison of differentially regulated genes between male and female adrenals via GSEA confirmed that ‘DNA replication’ and ‘immune response’ were among the top enriched pathways in female and male adrenals, respectively ( Fig. S4C [this file] ). 
Sex-specific proliferation was not observed before puberty, as male and female GOF adrenals both showed increased proliferation rates during embryogenesis ( Fig. S5A,B [this file] ), whereas ordinary two-way ANOVA analysis showed the absence of interactive effect between sex and the presence of the transgene at this early stage ( =0.8311). 
In order to test whether the phenotype we observed was specific to , we analyzed the effect of ectopic expression in the adrenal cortex, taking advantage of a previously published allele in the locus ( Hilkens et al., 2017 [rid=DMM050053C34] ) and the system ( Fig. S6A [this file] ). overexpression phenocopied our model in terms of sex-specific hyperplasia and ectopic proliferation at 6 weeks of age ( Fig. S6B,C [this file] ). However, we were not able to compare the two models directly because the expression of the transgene was not uniform ( Fig. S6D [this file] ). 
Several genes expressed in macrophages and monocytes, as well as pan-immune cell markers, were upregulated in male adrenals ( Fig. S7A [this file] ). Moreover, IBA1 ( ), a macrophage marker that has been shown to be induced in knockout animals ( Ishii et al., 2012 [rid=DMM050053C36] ), was strongly expressed in male adrenals, but not in their female counterparts ( Fig. S7B [this file] ). On the contrary, male-specific foamy cell formation was not observed when overexpression was activated by the adrenal cortex-specific aldosterone synthase (AS) - line ( Freedman et al., 2013 [rid=DMM050053C26] ) (more details about this genetic model are provided in the ‘AR signaling determines sexual dimorphism in Rspo1GOF adrenals’ section) ( Fig. S7C [this file] ). 
Expression analysis revealed a slight reduction of the AR gene ( ), as well as a dramatic increase in the expression of , a putative androgen-responsive gene in the adrenal cortex (as suggested by our RNA-seq data and previous transcriptomic analyses; El Wakil et al., 2013 [rid=DMM050053C21] ) ( Fig. S8B [this file] ). Moreover, DHT treatment dramatically reduced normalized adrenal weight and proliferation levels in the adrenal cortex ( Fig. 4 [rid=DMM050053F4] D,E) but did not lead to histological changes such as cytoplasmic vacuolization ( Fig. S8A [this file] ). However, the expression of cell cycle genes that are also known β-catenin targets ( and ) ( Shtutman et al., 1999 [rid=DMM050053C64] ; Van de Wetering et al., 2002 [rid=DMM050053C66] ) did not show statistically significant changes after treatment, suggesting that the effect of the androgens on cell cycle progression is not due to direct regulation of β-catenin targets ( Fig. S8B [this file] ). Furthermore, DHT treatment led to an increase in expression levels and to a decrease in expression levels ( Fig. S8B [this file] ), similarly to what RNA Scope ISH analysis suggested regarding the effect of sex on the expression of WNT-related genes ( Fig. 3 [rid=DMM050053F3] C,E). Interestingly, long-term DHT treatment did not cause consistent changes in the subcellular localization of β-catenin in the inner cortex ( Fig. S8C [this file] ). 
Moreover, male / and female adrenals appeared similar on the histological level, characterized by cortical hyperplasia ( Fig. S9A [this file] ). The observed variability among different animals ( Fig. 5 [rid=DMM050053F5] C,D) is likely due to incomplete deletion of the allele in clusters of adrenocortical cells ( Fig. S9B [this file] ). Surprisingly, deletion led to a mild increase of β-catenin accumulation in cells in certain areas of the inner cortex of male adrenals ( Fig. S9C [this file] ). However, quantification of expression in the outer and inner cortex using RNA Scope ISH ( Fig. S9D [this file] ) revealed no significant changes, suggesting that deletion does not translate into a change of transcriptional activity of β-catenin. 
This discrepancy might reflect the differential rates of Cre activation, as is active during embryogenesis, whereas the line results in cortex-wide recombination only at 5[this file] weeks of age ( Freedman et al., 2013 [rid=DMM050053C26] ). 
Primary antibodies were applied overnight at 4°C diluted in 3% normal donkey serum, 3% BSA and 0.1% Tween-20 as explained in Table S2 [this file] . The next day, sections were incubated at room temperature with secondary antibodies donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 647, donkey anti-goat Alexa Fluor 555, donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555, donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 and donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 diluted 1:400 in PBS (see Table S2 [this file] ). For anti-AR and anti-IBA1 immunohistochemistry, sections were incubated with biotinylated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (see Table S2 [this file] ) and the signal was revealed using the Vectastain Elite ABC-HRP peroxidase kit and the ImmPACT NovaRED HRP substrate (Vector Laboratories).

Using the heterozygous mutant human iPSC line (NAT1 ), we performed a second round targeting the other NAT1 allele by knocking-in a puromycin-resistance gene (Puro) ( Figure S1A [href=this file] ). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening to detect homologous recombinants indicated that all clones had Puro but not Neo even though the targeted alleles no longer had the guide RNA (gRNA) recognition site for CRISPR excision ( Figures S1B [href=this file] and S1C [href=this file] ). We introduced a doxycycline (Dox)-inducible NAT1 transgene (Tg) into NAT1 human iPSCs and performed second round targeting in these cells (NAT1 + Tg) in the presence of Dox ( Figure S1D [href=this file] ). Southern blotting showed that both NAT1 alleles were successfully deleted with the support of exogenous NAT1 expression ( Figure S1E [href=this file] ). Western blotting confirmed the precise regulation of NAT1 transgenes by Dox ( Figure S1F [href=this file] ). Time course analysis and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) showed that the expression of NAT1 in cKO human iPSCs dropped to less than 0.5% on day 3 after Dox removal, and Dox addition quickly recovered NAT1 expression to the endogenous level within one day ( Figure S1G [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S1 [href=this file] .
See also Figure S2 [href=this file] .
These HERV-H KD iPSCs remained undifferentiated on day 6 after the removal of Dox (NAT1) in F/A condition ( Figures 3E [href=#F3] and S2A) although they failed to self-renew by day 12 ( Figure S2B [href=this file] ). As we predicted, HERV-H suppression enabled NAT1-deficient human iPSCs to differentiate into neural lineage by EB formation ( Figures S2C [href=this file] and S2D [href=this file] ) and dSMADi ( Figures 3F [href=#F3] and 3G [href=#F3] ).
To address if the role of NAT1 in primed pluripotency is conserved in different species, we generated a NAT1 cKO mouse EpiSC line, which possesses similar characteristics to human iPSCs, such as the dependency on FGF and Activin A (F/A) ( Figures S3A [href=this file] – S3D [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S3 [href=this file] .
CRISPRi-induced NAT1 KD was also accompanied by decrease in TUT7 protein ( Figure S4 [href=this file] ).
See also Figure S4 [href=this file] .
See also Figure S5 [href=this file] .
See also Figure S6 [href=this file] .
To test if the decreased TUT7 protein expression contributed to the neural differentiation defect phenotypes in NAT1-depleted cells, we generated a Dox-inducible TUT7 cKD human iPSC line by CRISPRi with more than 99.9% efficiency ( Figure S5A [href=this file] ). TUT7 KD human iPSCs could expand normally while maintaining pluripotency marker expression ( Figures S5A [href=this file] and S5C [href=this file] ). In contrast, TUT7-depletion lowered the neural differentiation potential of human iPSCs ( Figures S5D [href=this file] – S5G [href=this file] ). On the other hand, we did not observe significant effects of TUT7-depletion on endoderm or mesoderm differentiation ( Figures S5D [href=this file] and S5E [href=this file] ).
As expected from the protein expression, the vector without 5’UTR rescued neural differentiation, suggesting that 5’UTR of TUT7 mRNA is responsible for the NAT1-dependent regulation ( Figures S6A [href=this file] and S6B [href=this file] ).
Also, the strength of NAT1’s effect on TUT7 translation varied in NAT1 cKO and cKD human iPSC lines, suggesting other mechanisms and/or pathways contribute to the regulation ( Figure S4 [href=this file] ).
On the other hand, in the NAT1 cKD iPSC line, we detected a significant increase of HERV-Hs despite a residual expression of TUT7 proteins ( Figures 5G [href=#F5] and S4 [href=this file] ).
In addition, NAT1 protein level in cKO cell line was roughly two-fold higher than that in cKD line ( Figure S4 [href=this file] ). This difference can be seen in their parental iPSC lines ( Figure S4 [href=this file] ).",pdf,Critical roles of translation initiation and RNA uridylation in endogenous retroviral expression and neural differentiation in pluripotent stem cells - PMC,HTML,"(2.5MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/8195978/bin/NIHMS1701674-supplement-4.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

Among these, we identified known PAX3 binding sites, such as the −111 kb and −57 kb elements controlling expression, a well-known Pax3 target gene during embryonic myogenesis (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1e, f [this file] ). 
Functional annotation of the loop anchors demonstrated enrichment for multiple biological process categories associated with embryonic and muscle development (Supplementary Fig. 1g, h [this file] ). Furthermore, 140/442 (33%) and 1615/4647 (35%) of 1-day and 6-day differentially expressed genes , respectively, overlap with anchor-annotated genes (Supplementary Fig. 1i, j [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ). Chromatin looping was also observed for several other genes, including , , , , , and (Fig. 1e [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] and see below). Establishment of long-range interactions at these sites coincided with a time-dependent increase in gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ), and in the case of the locus, epigenetic remodeling at the TSS region ( +0.7 kb—Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] ). 
Visual inspection of the region and other genomic loci characterized by long-range chromatin interactions upon Pax3 induction showed an increased deposition of the epigenetic marks associated with gene activation, in agreement with our ChIP-qPCR data for H3K4me3 (Fig. 2a [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 2b, c [this file] ). Using a k-means clustering algorithm, PAX3 binding sites can be categorized into four distinct types of chromatin state (clusters 1–4 in Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ), which displayed also different genomic distribution relative to the closest annotated gene (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] and Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM6] ). PAX3 had no effect on the epigenetic status of clusters 2 and 3 loci (565 and 135 peaks, respectively—Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ), which based on their histone marks profile can be categorized as elements proximal to TSS and repressed loci. These results were consistent across biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). In agreement with Pax3 function in the epigenetic reprogramming of its binding sites, comparison of ChIP-seq data in mesodermal cells (1-day) and myogenic progenitors (6-day) for these histone marks revealed a time-dependent increase in H3K4me1 and H3K27Ac at 83% (3132/3780 total) of PAX3 binding sites (clusters 1A and 4A in Supplementary Fig. 3d, e [this file] ). 
Out of 52 enhancers annotated as active in the somites, 9 overlapped with PAX3 ChIP-seq peaks (Fig. 2d, f [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 5a–c [this file] ). Overlapping of PAX3 binding sites was also observed for elements active in the developing limb and in the neural tube (Supplementary Fig. 5a, d [this file] ), which represent known Pax3-expressing tissues . 
For this, we generated a Pax3-tagged cell line (iPax3HaFlag), which displayed equal myogenic activity as the untagged protein (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ). Consistently, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation using anti-LDB1 antibody confirmed interaction with PAX3 and the closely related myogenic transcription factor PAX7 (Supplementary Fig. 6c, d [this file] ). Importantly, we observed co-localization of PAX3-LDB1 and PAX3-SMC1 in the nuclei of E9.5 mouse embryo somites (Fig. 3f [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Fig. 6e [this file] ). 
This analysis yielded 4483 LDB1 and 13377 SMC1 peaks in Pax3-induced mesodermal cells (1-day), whereas non-induced displayed 6317 LDB1 and 19082 SMC1 peaks (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] and Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM6] ). This analysis yielded 55177 and 53669 CTCF peaks in 1-day Pax3-induced and non-induced cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] and Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM6] ). Comparison of these ChIP-seq data demonstrated a high degree of overlap between SMC1 and CTCF peaks (92% and 87% in dox-induced and non-induced iPax3 cells, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). On the other hand, only a small percentage of LDB1 sites overlapped with SMC1 and CTCF peaks (22% and 25% in dox-induced and non-induced iPax3 cells, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). Whereas SMC1 appeared to be bound independently of PAX3 induction (cluster 3 in Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] ), this was not the case for LDB1 as PAX3-dependent LDB1 recruitment at cluster 1 loci was evident (Fig. 4a, b [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. 7e [this file] ), which we confirmed by ChIP-qPCR (Supplementary Figs. 7b [this file] and 8a [this file] and see below). Following annotation to the nearest TSS, this last group of loci includes genes essential for myogenesis, such as and , as well as multiple differentially regulated genes based on RNA-seq data (185/539 gene annotated peaks; Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] ). These results were consistent across biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). Importantly, our data show that PAX3 bound elements are occupied either by LDB1 or SMC1/CTCF but not both (Fig. 4a, b [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. 7e [this file] ), implying a differential role for these proteins in the regulation of Pax3-mediated myogenic activation. 
This was clear in both clusters characterized by H3K4me1 + low and high H3K27Ac levels (Fig. 4c [rid=Fig4] ), and was consistent across biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). In contrast, PAX3 only loci displayed an enrichment for a more heterogeneous group of biological process categories (Supplementary Fig. 7g [this file] ). 
Examples of such interactions involve the + 135 kb and + 158 kb elements characterized by PAX3-mediated LDB1 recruitment (Fig. 4b, d [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. 7e, f [this file] ). 
Recruitment of Ldb1 occurs at a subset of Pax3 sites overlapping with in vivo functional enhancers characterized by epigenetic remodeling (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] and Supplementary Fig. 7d [this file] ). 
Visual inspection of the HiChIP matrices confirmed the reduced long-range interactions at loci characterized by PAX3-dependent LDB1 recruitment ( and loci in Fig. 5g [rid=Fig5] and in Supplementary Fig. 7h [this file] ). 
The Pax3-inducible ES cell system represents the ideal tool for these studies as derivation of skeletal muscle cells is entirely dependent on Pax3 induction (Supplementary Fig. 1a–d [this file] ). Importantly, we show here that the ΔTAD mutant is incapable of recruiting LDB1 nor inducing H3K4me1 deposition at PAX3 binding sites (Fig. 6c [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 8a, e [this file] ), while still maintaining its DNA binding capability (Supplementary Fig. 8b [this file] ). We generated dox-inducible ES cell lines expressing ΔTAD fusion proteins in frame with the cDNA encoding for Ldb1, Ash2l, Cxxc1, and Pagr1a (Fig. 6b [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 8c [this file] ). This was consistent with gene expression data of mesodermal cells (1-day induced), as most Pax3 target genes are efficiently upregulated only by WT and ΔTAD-LDB1 proteins (Fig. 6e [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 8d [this file] ). 
Since Pax3 expression induces deposition of H3K4me1 at a subset of enhancers (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] ) and co-immunoprecipitation using LDB1 antibody shows interaction with PAX3, ASH2L, and WDR5 (Supplemental Fig. 5c [this file] ), we next investigated the effect of ΔTAD-LDB1 and ΔTAD-ASH2L proteins on histone 3 posttranslational modification. Consistently, ChIP using the H3K4me1 antibody demonstrated increased levels of this mark at PAX3 bound elements (e.g., −111 kb enhancer) following induction of full length PAX3, whereas the ΔTAD mutant lacked this activity (Supplemental Fig. 7e [this file] ). Similar results were obtained following induction of ΔTAD-LDB1, whereas ΔTAD-ASH2L was able to induce H3K4me1 only at a subset of Pax3 sites (Supplementary Fig. 8e [this file] ). Inspection of genomic tracks for dox-induced and non-induced WT, ΔTAD, and ΔTAD-LDB1 lines confirmed our ChIP-qPCR data at important myogenic loci ( , −111 kb and ; Supplementary Fig. 8f [this file] ). On a global scale, using the list of 1-day PAX3 bound elements, k-means clustering identified that only a subset of sites (3725/7508) display a ΔTAD-LDB1-dependent increase in H3K4me1 levels (Fig. 6g, h [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 8g [this file] ). 
We confirmed deletion by immunostaining for LDB1 in E9.5 embryos (Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] ). 
Interestingly, this effect was specific for LDB1 as fusion proteins involving subunits of the HMT complex failed to robustly induce myogenesis, regardless of their ability to increase H3K4me1 levels at a subset of Pax3 sites (Supplementary Fig. 8e [this file] ). 
Co-immunoprecipitation of LDB1 in iPax3 cells showed the interaction with the HMT complex subunits ASH2L and WDR5 (Supplementary Fig. 6c [this file] ), and expression of the PAX3 ΔTAD-LDB1 fusion protein was able to induce an increase in H3K4me1 at a subset of PAX3 bound sites (Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ).

Using the expression of well-established marker genes, we were able to identify all main cardiac cell types, such as cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and immune cells (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1b-g [this file] and Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM4] ). 
To study the function of ZEB2 in cardiomyocytes, we generated cardiomyocyte-specific Zeb2 knockout mice ( cKO) (Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ). QPCR analysis indicated approximately a 50% reduction in cardiac expression levels in cKO mice compared to control ( fl/fl) (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ). Under baseline conditions deleting from cardiomyocytes did not appear to induce any gross morphological or functional changes (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] , and Fig. 2c–g [rid=Fig2] ). 
Compared to the fl/fl mice, cKO mice experienced a greater cardiac dysfunction as measured by fractional shortening (FS) and a non-significant increase in left ventricular internal diameter in systole (LVIDs) post-MI (Fig. 2d, e [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). We also observed an increase in infarct size in cKO compared with fl/fl mice, assessed by the percentage of the infarcted area of the total LV circumference (Supplementary Fig. 3b-c [this file] ). A decrease in capillary density and expression of endothelial markers was also observed in Zeb2 cKO mice after sham, implying a vascular difference at baseline (Supplementary Fig. 3d–j [this file] ). 
In doing so, we found 2339 (-0,2 Log2 fold change) downregulated and 1599 (0,2 Log2 fold change) upregulated genes (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] and Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM6] ). The differential expression of the top regulated genes could be confirmed by qPCR in a larger sample set ( = 7) (Supplementary Fig. 4b-c [this file] ). Pathway analysis showed that upregulated genes were mainly linked to metabolic pathways (Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] ), whereas downregulated genes were involved in, among others, focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, and regulation of actin cytoskeleton (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ), suggesting a decline in cell survival and angiogenic response in cKO hearts compared to wild type littermates . This overrepresentation of pathways involved in ECM and vasculature maintenance indicated that deleting did not only affect cardiomyocytes but also other cell types, suggesting a cell non-autonomous function mediated by ZEB2 (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ). 
To this end, we inhibited ZEB2 in hypoxic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs), after which we collected the conditioned medium and added it on either freshly cultured NRCMs or the non-cardiomyocyte fraction of cells (non-CMs) from the same isolation (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). We did not observe any significant differences in the cardiomyocyte fraction when exposed to the conditioned medium from treated cardiomyocytes (Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] ). However, in using the same conditioned medium, the non-CMs cells did show a decrease in ECM/fibrotic and endothelial genes (Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). 
While the expression of many factors did not change in cKO mice post-MI, we observed a significant downregulation for and (Fig. 4a–b [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 6a–i [this file] ). These data imply a possible regulation of and by ZEB2 most likely due to multiple ZEB2 binding sites present in close proximity to the transcription starting site (TSS) in and in mouse and human (Supplementary Fig. 6j [this file] ). Additionally, we made use of existing ChIP-seq data ( https://www.encodeproject.org/targets/ZEB2-human/ (https://www.encodeproject.org/targets/ZEB2-human/) ) and identified ZEB2 binding motifs in enhancer regions of both TMSB4 and PTMA (Supplementary Fig. 6k-l [this file] ), indicating that ZEB2 protein can directly bind to those enhancers causing an increase in TMSB4 and PTMA expression. 
To examine the secretory and pro-angiogenic effect of TMSB4 and PTMA from cardiomyocytes, we infected human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes with adeno-associated viruses overexpressing either ZEB2, TMSB4 or PTMA in the absence or presence of a siRNA targeting ZEB2 or a control (Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ). This resulted in an increase or decrease in expression compared to control cells, as indicated by qPCR analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7b-e [this file] ). Conditioned medium from cardiomyocytes overexpressing ZEB2, TMSB4 or PTMA enhanced the migration of endothelial cells, with no apparent additive effect when overexpressing both TMSB4 or PTMA (Supplementary Fig. 7f-g [this file] ). Conversely, exposing endothelial cells to conditioned medium from iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes treated with a siRNA against ZEB2, lowered endothelial cell migration (Supplementary Fig. 7h-i [this file] ). However, this inhibitory effect could be rescued by the conditioned medium from cardiomyocytes, where ZEB2 inhibition was followed by overexpression of TMSB4 or PTMA (Supplementary Fig. 7h-i [this file] ). 
To do so, we crossed Rosa26-LoxSTOPLox-ZEB2 mice with mice overexpressing Cre recombinase under the control of the cardiac-specific α-myosin heavy chain promoter (αMHC-Cre Tg) (Supplementary Fig. 8a-b [this file] ). Overexpression of was confirmed by qPCR for (and ) (Supplementary Fig. 8c-d [this file] ). Compared to WT littermates, we did not observe any morphological or functional effects of ZEB2 overexpression under baseline conditions (Supplementary Fig. 8e–g [this file] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
To study the function of ZEB2 overexpression during an ischemic event, we subjected cTg mice to MI for 14 days, after which we performed functional and molecular analyses (Fig. 7a [rid=Fig7] ). cTg-based overexpression was confirmed on mRNA (Fig. 7b–c [rid=Fig7] ) and protein level (Fig. 7d [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 9a [this file] ). Echocardiography showed an improvement in cardiac function (FS), a decline in left ventricular internal diameter (LVIDs), and smaller infarct size in mice overexpressing ZEB2 in cardiomyocytes (Fig. 7e–f [rid=Fig7] , Supplementary Fig. 9b–d [this file] and Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
Additionally, we already observed a mild increase in capillary density and endothelial markers under sham conditions, which can potentially contribute to the enhanced angiogenesis post-MI (Supplementary Fig. 9e-k [this file] . In line with the protective consequences of overexpressing ZEB2 in cardiomyocytes, we observed an increase in the expression of the pro-survival gene BCL-XL in cTg mice post-MI (Supplementary Fig. 9l-m [this file] ). 
We generated AAV9-control and AAV9-Zeb2 (Supplementary Fig. 10a [this file] ) and tested different routes of delivery, including intraperitoneal (IP) injection into mouse pups, and intracardiac (IC) and intravenous (IV) injection into adult mice (Supplementary Fig. 10b–d [this file] ). Since intracardiac injection resulted in the strongest increase in expression of in the heart (Supplementary Fig. 10c [this file] ), we used this method for our subsequent experiments. 
ZEB2 expression was confirmed to be increased at both times points post-injection (Fig. 8b–d [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11a–c [this file] ). Increasing ZEB2 in cardiomyocytes improved cardiac function and morphology after MI at both time points as measured by FS and LVID (Fig. 8e–f [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11d-e [this file] , Supplementary Table 5 [this file] , Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ). We detected a significant increase in levels in response to ZEB2 delivery (Fig. 8g–j [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11f–i [this file] ). This corresponded with an increase in and expression (Fig. 8k–m [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11j–l [this file] ) and an overall increase in the PECAM1 positive area in cTg hearts (Fig. 8n [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11m [this file] ). Additionally, when increasing ZEB2, we observed a trend in elevated levels of the pro-survival gene BCL-XL 28 days post- MI (Fig. 8o–p [rid=Fig8] ) and smaller cardiomyocyte size in the remote area as indicated by WGA staining (Fig. 8q–r [rid=Fig8] and Supplementary Fig. 11n-o [this file] ). 
All mice were genotyped by PCR using primers shown in Supplementary Table 7 [this file] . 
Primer sequences are provided in Supplementary Table 7 [this file] . 
Cells were subjected to hypoxia (1%O and 5%CO ) for 6 h before collection (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ).",pdf,Cardiomyocytes stimulate angiogenesis after ischemic injury in a ZEB2-dependent manner,XML,,,,,,,

Briefly, fruit powder samples were treated with a methanol/chloroform mixture generating corresponding hydroalcoholic and organic extracts (see Supplementary Material [this file] for details), which were then dried and stored at -20°C. NMR spectra were recorded at 27°C on a Bruker AVANCE 600 instrument operating under experimental conditions described previously ( Salzano et al., 2018 [rid=B84] ) and in Supplementary Material [this file] . Metabolite concentrations were derived from the integral values of the corresponding resonances in H NMR spectra ( Supplementary Material [this file] ). 
Polyphenolic compounds from kiwifruit samples taken at T0–T3 were extracted as reported previously ( Salzano et al., 2018 [rid=B84] ) and in Supplementary Material [this file] . 
Kiwifruit outer pericarp samples taken at T0–T3 were extracted for proteins using a modified version of the phenol/SDS-based method ( Corrado et al., 2012 [rid=B20] ; D’Ambrosio et al., 2013 [rid=B22] ; Salzano et al., 2018 [rid=B84] ), which were then quantified as reported in Supplementary Material [this file] . Proteins in each biological replicate were then resolved and quantified according to the 2D-DIGE procedure ( Alban et al., 2003 [rid=B2] ; Salzano et al., 2018 [rid=B84] ) (see Supplementary Material [this file] for details).

As observed by the plot of loadings, variables responsible for this trend were sugars (SUCR, AGLC, BGLC, and BFRUPY), AA, Thr, Ile, Val, and DUFA (see the legend to Figure 1 [rid=F1] for abbreviations), which were present at a higher level during the final stages of postharvest ( Supplementary Figures S1 [this file] , S2 [this file] ); conversely, Ala and DG showed the highest level at T0. As expected, the trend showed by single metabolites ( Supplementary Figures S1 [this file] , S2 [this file] ) confirmed the results of PCA. Regarding the organic extracts, a constant increment and decrement of DUFA and DG was observed, respectively, whereas the other metabolites remained practically unchanged ( Supplementary Figure S2 [this file] ). 
In order to identify molecular effectors/metabolic pathways deregulated as result of kiwifruit cold storage, protein extracts from fruit samples taken at T0 (reference) and T1–T3 were comparatively evaluated by 2D-DIGE ( Supplementary Table S1 [this file] ). Corresponding proteomic maps showed the presence of almost 4100 spots occurring within M and p ranges of 10–100 kDa and 3–10, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] ). These spots were further filtered for abundance fold changes ≥1.5 or ≤-1.5 (T1–T3 vs. T0) and -value ≤ 0.05 (Student’s paired -test), ascertaining 311 differentially represented ones (DRSs) associated with cold storage ( Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] ). Hierarchical clustering of spot abundance ratios highlighted that most significant quantitative variations occurred at T3, which corresponded to apex in C H emission ( Supplementary Figure S4 [this file] and Table 1 [rid=T1] ). Since some DRSs showed the occurrence of two comigrating proteins within the same spot, results were further filtered as reported in the experimental section to exclude: (i) spots containing molecular species with no coherent quantitative levels in 2D-DIGE; (ii) comigrating proteins having a unique quantitative determination as deduced by 2D-DIGE ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ). 
A heat-map picture originated from hierarchical clustering of quantity ratios of DRPs for each functional group during kiwifruit cold storage is shown in Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] ; it describes the dynamic expression profile of the various proteins among different storage stages. 
A bioinformatic prediction of protein–protein interactions among homologs of here-ascertained kiwifruit DRPs revealed a highly-ramified network bridging 98 sequence entries ( Figure 5 [rid=F5] and Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ), which corresponded to four main functional groups partially structured into three subnetworks. An analysis of the heat-map representation ( Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] ) of the interacting proteins within the main network showed a general common dynamic trend over time, mainly concentrated at T3. 
Abbreviations are reported in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . 
In fact, these components become progressively down-represented at T2 and T3 ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5A,F [this file] ). On the other hand, a coherent opposite behavior with respect to kiwifruit physiological maturation was also observed for monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDAR1), which showed an augmented representation at T3 ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5A [this file] ). Since MDAR1 catalyzes the recycling conversion of monodehydroascorbate into AA ( Noctor and Foyer, 1998 [rid=B68] ), its increased levels well correlated with the rise of AA concentration measured during cold storage of harvest kiwifruit ( Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] ). A similar quantitative profile was also verified for over-representation of cytosolic aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH7B4 (AT1G54100) ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5G [this file] ), which is induced in plants as result of various abiotic stress conditions ( Stiti et al., 2011 [rid=B90] ). 
In fact, while α-toxin, chitinase (HCHIB) and NtPRp27-like protein showed reduced levels at T1–T3, lectin exhibited an opposite condition, and abundant kiwellin, thaumatin-like protein isoforms (OSM34) and major latex-like protein (Bet VI class) presented a mixed profile, also associated with a decreased representation of corresponding proteolytic fragments ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5A [this file] ). These proteins can induce strong allergic reactions in humans and thus were identified among the most effective allergens in kiwifruit ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ) ( Bulley, 2016 [rid=B15] ). 
The list of proteins involved in abiotic/biotic stress responses showing a differential representation in harvest kiwifruit after cold storage also included various chaperones, heat shock proteins (HSPs) and protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) that, contributing to a proper polypeptide folding and disulfide pairing, were already described as being involved in plant defense against different environmental challenges ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5A,B [this file] ) ( Timperio et al., 2008 [rid=B98] ). 
In the case of kiwifruit cold storage, these mechanisms seem to include the induction of various proteolytic enzymes, i.e., putative aminopeptidases (AT1G63770), subtilisin-like proteases (ARA12 and AT5G67090), acylamino-acid-releasing enzyme (AARE) and Xaa-pro aminopeptidase (APP1), and of components of the ubiquitin/26S proteasome machinery, namely 26S proteasome regulatory subunit (AT5G23540) and non-ATPase regulatory subunit (ATS9), which were over-represented at T1–T3 ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5B [this file] ). The probable occurrence of compensative mechanisms promoting protein synthesis under stressful conditions to maintain total protein levels unaltered fitted with the observation of increased levels of elongation factor isoforms LOS1 (LOS1), eukaryotic initiation factor 4A (EIF4A-1), ATP-binding cassette (ABCF1), Gly-tRNA ligase isoforms (AT1G29880), and Arg-tRNA ligase (emb1027) during kiwifruit cold storage ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5C [this file] ). 
Finally, cysteine proteases cathepsin S (RD21B) and cathepsin B-like (RD21A), also known as actinidin and actinidin Act2a, respectively, showed reduced levels at T1–T3 ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5B [this file] ). Actinidins are among the most abundant proteins in physiologically ripe kiwifruit and banana, and were recognized as major allergens therein ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ) ( Bulley, 2016 [rid=B15] ; Du et al., 2016 [rid=B26] ). 
In particular, cell wall structural components, i.e., arabinogalactan protein (AT5G11680) and pro-resilin (AT5G39570), and cytoskeletal proteins, namely actin 1 (ACT7), annexin (ANNAT4) and tubulin beta-2 chain (TUB5), showed reduced levels at T2–T3 ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5D,M [this file] ). Above-reported findings were paralleled by over-representation of enzymes regulating cell wall pectin and hemicellulose degradation, namely pectinesterase-2 (PME51), pectinesterase inhibitor (PMEI2), β-xylosidase 4 (XYL4), polygalacturonase-inhibitor protein (PGIP1), putative uncharacterized proteins P0046B10.2-1 (AT3G08030 and AT5G11420) and anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (AT1G70570), which in some cases showed increased levels even at T1 or were characterized for their over-representation in T2–T3 range ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5D,F,M [this file] ). 
In this context, progressively increasing SSC values ascertained at T1–T3 ( Table 1 [rid=T1] ) and corresponding sugar (SUCR, AGLC, BGLC, and BFRUPY) levels ( Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] ) were coherent with the over-representation of enzymes involved in starch degradation and sucrose metabolism, namely glycogen debranching enzyme (ISA3), α-glucan phosphorylase (PHS2), phosphoglucomutase isoforms (PGM2) and phosphofructokinase (PFK3) ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5F,G [this file] ), thus providing a rationale to measured metabolite amounts. Two GTP-binding proteins regulating glycolytic/TCA cycle pathways by a direct interaction with above-mentioned enzymes as well as chloroplast development, membrane fission and sensitivity to hormones were also over-represented in the same time range, namely GTPase obg (AT1G30580) and dynamin (DL1E) ( Colaneri and Jones, 2014 [rid=B19] ) ( Supplementary Figures S5E,M [this file] ). Regulation of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle pathways in kiwifruit was also ensured through down-representation of triosephosphate isomerase (TIM), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC2) and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (LPD1) (showing decreased levels at T1 and T3, respectively) ( Supplementary Figures S5F,G [this file] ). 
In particular, increased levels of AT5G01320 were coherent with promoted conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis into toxic acetaldehyde, which then was converted into ethanol by the detoxifying action of augmented AT4G13010, also enabling production of NADH, or transformed into acetate by increased levels of aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH2B4 (AT3G48000) ( Wei et al., 2009 [rid=B104] ; Stiti et al., 2011 [rid=B90] ) ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5F,G [this file] ). Conversely, a down-representation of enzymes involved in photosynthesis was observed, namely ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase large chain (RBCL), ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase small chain (RBCS1A), and oxygen-evolving enhancer protein 1 (PSBO1); a similar trend was also observed for plastid-lipid-associated protein (AT4G22240) and chloroplastic outer envelope pore protein 24 (AT1G45170) ( Supplementary Figures S5D,G,M [this file] ). Nevertheless, energy supply in fruit seemed guaranteed by dedicated compensative mechanisms, as evidenced by increased levels measured for V-type ATP synthase alpha chain (VHA-A), V-type proton ATPase subunit E (VHA-E3) and NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase isoforms (EMB1467) isoforms in the T1–T3 range ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5G,L [this file] ). 
In fact, Val, Ile, Thr, Ala, Trp, Asp, Glu, and GAB showed variable quantitative levels overtime, which were also different with respect to counterparts ascertained during fruit physiological development ( Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] ). Proteomic results at T1–T3 were frequently indicative of the modulation of the corresponding anabolic/catabolic pathways ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5F–H [this file] ). More complex was the tentative explanation of Asp, Ala, Glu, and GABA levels in the course of kiwifruit cold storage ( Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] ), based on multiple (overlapping) metabolic pathways in which these amino acids are involved ( Ainalidou et al., 2016 [rid=B1] ), and the limited information on corresponding enzyme representation trends ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figure S5F [this file] ). Over-representation of above-mentioned proteins and C H well paralleled with a concomitant increase of AA concentration in kiwifruit during cold storage ( Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] ), further supporting the important relation between AA, ROS, and C H -regulated enzymes during fruit postharvest ( Lum et al., 2016 [rid=B54] ). 
On the other hand, different enzymes involved in purine/pyrimidine catabolism were over-represented in T1–T3 range, namely uricase (urate oxidase) (AT2G26230) and dihydropyrimidase (PYD2) ( Supplementary Figure S5F [this file] ), in agreement with analogous reports on other fruits during postharvest management or in plants subjected to cold stress. The first enzyme is involved in uric acid oxidation, thus removing this sparingly soluble plant metabolite, while the second one is involved in uridine degradation, providing a rationale to the decreased levels of this pyrimidine measured overtime ( Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] ). 
Regarding kiwifruit proteins involved in secondary metabolite anabolism/catabolism, proteomic data showed an over-representation at T1–T2 of cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase 4 (ATCAD4), as already observed during ripening of banana ( Du et al., 2016 [rid=B26] ), whereas 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (ACAT2) and rubber elongation factor (REF) showed increased levels even at earlier stages ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] and Supplementary Figures S5F,H,M [this file] ). Over-representation of ACAT2 during kiwifruit cold storage was tentatively associated with increased or, at least, constant concentration of S7, ST, and bSC, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S2 [this file] ), although a rationale justifying the specific quantitative levels overtime of these sterols was not deduced.",pdf,Unveiling Kiwifruit Metabolite and Protein Changes in the Course of Postharvest Cold Storage,XML,,,,,,,

Likewise, the top cellular components highlight several chromatin/chromosome organization categories (8/15 categories), as well as protein/histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase complexes (5/15 categories; Figure S1B [this file] ). Lastly, the gene set’s top molecular functions include several enzymatic categories relevant to gene regulation, such as methyltransferases and kinases, guanyl-nucleotide factors and regulators, and protein/RNA binding ( Figure S1C [this file] ). 
We further confirmed several of these events by low-cycle RT-PCR ( Figures 1C [rid=F1] and S1D [this file] ). Overall, the majority of the splicing events follow the cassette exon (CE) splicing pattern (regulated full-length exon), while a smaller fraction of events are categorized as intron retention (IR), alternative splice site, or alternative first exon (AFE/transcription start site [TSS]; Figure S1D [this file] ). 
Given this precedent, we were interested in determining the functional consequence of stimulation-induced splicing of , the gene for which we observe the next largest change in inclusion of a CE in the coding sequence after ( Figure S1D [this file] ). 
The stimulation-induced splicing change in quantified by MAJIQ corresponds to a predicted 44% increase in inclusion of exon 9 ( ) upon T cell stimulation ( Figure S1D [this file] ). 
When is included, the resultant encoded protein is 952 amino acids and includes a nuclear localization signal (NLS); a characterized and a putative nuclear export signal (NES); a deacetylase domain; sites of co-repressor interaction; and multiple sites of known modifications ( Figure S2 [this file] ). 
We validated the CRISPR clones by Sanger sequencing of both the genomic DNA (gDNA) and resultant mRNA transcripts products after PCR/RT-PCR amplification ( Figures 3B [rid=F3] and S3A [this file] – S3C [this file] ). 
To test this, we treated both stimulated and unstimulated cells with cycloheximide (CHX) to block translation and assessed protein abundance by western blot ( Figures S3D [this file] and S3E [this file] ). 
Consistently, we find that the increased interaction of the iE9 isoform of HDAC7 with 14-3-3 proteins relative to the ΔE9 isoform correlates with a decrease in interaction with at least one transcription factor, LEF1 ( Figure 3F [rid=F3] ), and histone H3 ( Figure S4A [this file] ). Notably, we observe multiple differences in hPTM abundance between the cells expressing exclusively HDAC7iE9 vs. HDAC7ΔE9, most significantly in the canonical and variant histone H3 proteins ( Figures 4A [rid=F4] and S4B [this file] ). Specifically, iE9-expressing cells have higher global levels of H3 acetylation and some reduction in H3 methylation than cells expressing exclusively the ΔE9 isoform, especially in unstimulated conditions ( Figures 4A [rid=F4] and S4B [this file] ). 
Indeed, after applying filter cutoffs of log fold change ≥|2|, adjusted p value ≤0.05, and base mean ≥20, we find virtually no differences in the transcription profile between WT and ΔE9 cells ( Figures 4D [rid=F4] and S5 [this file] ), while there are 277 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between iE9 and WT in unstimulated cells and 222 in stimulated conditions (in total, 409 DEGs combined; Figure 4D [rid=F4] ; Data S1 [this file] ). Similarly, we find 235 DEGs between iE9 and ΔE9 cells in unstimulated cells and 229 in stimulated conditions ( Figure S5A [this file] ). Therefore, we conclude that the shift in alternative splicing toward iE9 upon stimulation results in increased sequestration of HDAC7 by 14-3-3 proteins, which, in turn, drives many changes in gene expression through changing hPTMs. We note that we also detect approximately 100 genes that exhibit alternative splicing in the ΔE9 and/or iE9 cells compared with WT ( Data S2 [this file] ), none of which overlap with the genes that display changes in expression in the CRISPR-modified cell lines. 
Indeed, in cells depleted of HDAC7 through a CRISPR-induced frameshift (knockout [KO]), we observe increased expression of at least and ( Figure S5B [this file] ), as we observe in the CRISPR iE9 cells ( Figure 5 [rid=F5] ). Moreover, reintroduction of the HDAC7-iE9 isoform in the KO cells does not alter and expression, while reintroduction of the HDAC7-ΔE9 isoform reduces and expression relative to the KO ( Figure S5B [this file] ). 
Finally, as further demonstration that the gene expression pattern observed in the CRISPR iE9 cells is due to loss of activity, rather than a gain of function due to overall higher HDAC7-iE9 protein levels, we treated cells with an antisense morpholino oligo (AMO) targeting the 5′ UTR of to block translation and knock down protein expression to bring the level of HDAC7-iE9 to that of HDAC7-ΔE9 ( Figure S6A [this file] ). Importantly, reduced expression of HDAC7-iE9 does not result in any appreciable changes in CD3ε, CD28, and CD69 cell surface expression with regards to either the percentage of positive cells or the MFI ( Figure S6B [this file] ). We ( Figure S7 [this file] ) and others have observed that the bulk of HDAC7 in WT T cells is in the cytoplasm, yet at least the ΔE9 isoform of HDAC7 does associate with histone H3 ( Figure S4A [this file] ).

Examining IGHD and IGHJ allele content, we found that SP01, SP02, SP06, SP08, and SP11 were heterozygous for IGHJ (IGHJ6 02/IGHJ6 03), SP14 was heterozygous for IGHD2-21 (IGHD2-21 01/IGHD2-21 02), and SP04 and SP05 were heterozygous for IGHD3-10 (IGHD3-10 01/IGHD3-10 01_S2851) ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] F and S1 [this file] A). Use of these anchors to haplotype IGHV alleles demonstrated that the presence of gene duplications resulting in structural variation between the chromosomes ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] F and S1 [this file] A). 
To expand upon this in a larger cohort, we analyzed available IgM repertoire data from 32 unrelated cases not previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. [xref] [rid=bib11] In this dataset, IGHV1-69 was the third most frequently used gene in the IgM repertoire ( Figure S1 [this file] B). This revealed that three of these cases had more than two alleles and one study participant had four IGHV1-69 alleles ( Figure S1 [this file] B). 
Of the CD20 CD27 IgG memory B cells, 2.7% were S specific ( Figures 2 [rid=fig2] B and S2 [this file] A). 
See also Figure S2 [this file] . 
All neutralizing mAbs bound the RBD ( Figure S2 [this file] B). The neutralization curves and IC values against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain are shown in Figure S2 [this file] C. 
Several of the most potently neutralizing mAbs used IGHV1-69, either IGHV1-69 02 or the recently identified IGHV1-69 20 allele. [xref] [rid=bib11] Two of the IGHV1-69 20-using mAbs, CAB-I12 and CAB-I47, were clonally related ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] F) and narrow in their neutralization profile against different SARS-CoV-2 variants ( Figure S2 [this file] D). 
See also Figure S3 [this file] . 
The KD measurements correlated well with the IC values from the neutralization assay ( Figures S3 [this file] A–S3C). 
Spike-specific memory B cells were sorted into 96-well plates using dual fluorescently labeled spike probes yielding 526 HC sequences ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] C and S4 [this file] A). 
See also Figure S4 [this file] . 
Both CAB-I47 and CAB-M77 also showed a greater reliance on their HC SHM than LC SHM as shown by testing the neutralizing activities of either or both HC and LC V gene germline-reverted versions of these mAbs compared with the mature Abs ( Figures S4 [this file] D–S4F). 
The main interaction site for both mAbs was mapped to aa 470–490 ( Figure S4 [this file] B), overlapping the site targeted by class 1 antibodies. [xref] [rid=bib35] To further evaluate CAB-I47, CAB-M77, and CAB-N86, we tested their capacity to neutralize a D614G virus encoding the RBD E484K mutation (Zeta), and we found that all three mAbs were sensitive to this mutation ( Figure S4 [this file] C). 
Extensive classification of picked particles resulted in two different states, a “1-up” state with three Fabs bound ( Figure 5 [rid=fig5] A) and a “2-up” state with three Fabs bound to each RBDs ( Figure S5 [this file] A). Therefore, we performed localized reconstruction and refinement of the RBD-Fab (variable heavy [VH] and variable light [VL]) part, resulting in a higher resolution map of overall 2.5Å (FSC 0.143) ( Figure S5 [this file] B), which helped us dissect the atomic details of the Fab-RBD interaction. 
See also Figure S5 [this file] . 
When examining antibodies for which nucleotide sequences were available, we identified several mAbs for which the closest assignment was the IGHV1-69 20 allele ( Figure S6 [this file] A). For neutralizing IGHV1-69-using antibodies in CoV-Ab-Dab for which only the amino acid sequence was available, we identified BD57-005, BD56-031 and XGv-232, [xref] [rid=bib39] REGN10977, [xref] [rid=bib40] C14646P3S, [xref] [rid=bib41] and C1210 and C1211, [xref] [rid=bib42] which could be assigned to IGHV1-69 20 due to the presence of R50, F55, I57, A72, and K74, a combination of residues only found in IGHV1-69 20 ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] D, 6 [rid=fig6] B, and S6 [this file] B). 
See also Figure S6 [this file] . 
After genotyping with IgDiscover, we haplotyped nine individuals from the Gidoni et al. study [xref] [rid=bib11] by IGHJ6 heterozygosity with RAbHIT v0.2.0. [xref] [rid=bib55] The gene usage boxplots in Figure S1 [this file] B were generated from sequences with zero mutations in the V and J loci, which were clonally collapsed by identical V assignment, J assignment, and CDR3 nucleotide sequence.

Several mAbs used IGHV3-53 and had short HCDR3s, suggesting that they were of the previously described class 1 group of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. [xref] [rid=bib31][xref] [rid=bib35] The IGHV3-53 01-using mAbs isolated here, including three clonally related mAbs, CAB-A17, CAB-A18, and CAB-A49, are separately described. [xref] [rid=bib36] One ultrapotent neutralizing mAb, CAB-F52, used IGHV3-30-3 01, a gene that is present in only a subset of individuals ( Table S1 [this file] ). 
To investigate whether similar antibodies could be isolated from an unrelated donor, we used samples from study participant SP13, the only other donor in our cohort who had the IGHV1-69 20 allele ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] A; Table S1 [this file] ). 
Of note, IGHV1-69 15 and IGHV1-69 18, which have identical coding sequences but differ at the nucleotide level, were not found in the 14 participants studied here ( Table S1 [this file] ), nor in the 32 individuals from Gidoni et al., [xref] [rid=bib11] suggesting that they are rare in the represented population groups, while IGHV1-69 20 is more common.",xls,Immunoglobulin germline gene polymorphisms influence the function of SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies,XML,,,,,,,
