To focus on the component of AD that is intrinsically encoded in neurons, we identified the neuron-specific expression component in each cohort by applying the PSEA deconvolution algorithm to the MAYO and ROSMAP transcriptomic datasets independently (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 1). We further focused on the molecular traits associated with AD by identifying DE gene signatures—comprised of several thousands of gene expression traits—between AD and cognitively normal samples for each dataset (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 2). To identify correlated gene expression traits associated with AD, we constructed gene co-expression networks for each dataset, and from these networks we identified highly interconnected sets of co-regulated genes (modules) that were significantly enriched for AD gene signatures (the significant DE genes) as well as for pathways previously implicated in AD (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 3). To obtain a final set of genes for input into the causal network construction process for each dataset, we combined genes in the co-expression network modules enriched for AD signatures (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 5—Module selection) and performed the pathFinder algorithm to enrich the seeding gene set by including genes upstream and downstream of this set from a compiled pathway database (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 5—Seeding expansion). 
With our input set of neuron-centered genes for the AD network constructions defined, we mapped expression-QTLs (eQTLs) for neuron-specific gene expression traits in each dataset to incorporate the eQTLs as structure priors in the network reconstructions, given that they provide a systematic perturbation source that can boost the power to infer causal relationships (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 4) . The input gene set and eQTL data were then processed by an ensemble of causal network inference methods, including Bayesian networks and our recently developed top-down and bottom-up predictive networks , in order to construct probabilistic causal network models of AD independently in the MAYO and ROSMAP cohorts (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 6). We next applied a statistical algorithm to detect key driver genes in each given network structure and to identify and prioritize master regulators in the AD networks (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Step 7). 
We processed matched genotype and RNAseq data separately in each dataset (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ; see ‘Methods’). 
After normalizing the bulk-tissue RNAseq data, we performed variance partition analysis (VPA) to evaluate the contributions of cell type-specific markers as well as demographic, clinical, and technical covariates (such as batch effects) to the gene expression variance before performing any covariate adjustment (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b [this file] ). 
We then repeated VPA in the neuron-specific residuals of each dataset to demonstrate that our deconvolution and covariate adjustment methods properly capture the neuronal component while removing potential confounds such as batch effect, age, and sex (Supplementary Fig. 2c, d [this file] ). Finally, to justify the use of single cell type-specific markers for deconvolution by the PSEA method, we performed a set of analyses comparing multiple cell type-specific biomarker lists (derived from existing scRNAseq studies) to each other (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ), to our AD residuals (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c [this file] ), and to the AMP-AD Agora list of potential therapeutic targets in AD (Supplementary Fig. 3j, k [this file] ), as well as a robustness analysis demonstrating that our neuron-specific residual derived from expression represents a robust neuronal component in the bulk-tissue RNAseq data when compared to random selections of multi-gene neuronal biomarkers derived from these scRNAseq datasets in AD (Supplementary Fig. 3b–i [this file] ; see ‘Methods’). 
In comparing expression data between AD and cognitively normal controls (MAYO: 79 AD, 76 control; ROSMAP: 212 AD, 194 control), there were 3674 significant DE neuron-specific genes in the MAYO dataset (hereby MAYO-neuron) and 6626 neuron-specific DE genes in the ROSMAP dataset (hereby ROSMAP-neuron) (Fig. 2a, b [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ; Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM3] ). 
See also Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] . Source data for this panel is provided in Supplementary Data 13 [this file5] . Detailed statistical results of DE genes and enriched pathways are summarized in Supplementary Data 1 [rid=MOESM3] and 2 [rid=MOESM4] , respectively, and overlapped pathways are summarized in Supplementary Data 13 [this file5] . 
We demonstrate 2 of the final 11 causal network models in Fig. 4a, b [rid=Fig4] (MAYO-Neuron-PredNet-Expanded-1 and ROSMAP-Neuron-PredNet-Expanded-1), and the remaining 9 causal networks are shown in Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] . 
See also Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] . , The top 50 out of 1563 total key driver targets ranked individually according to impact ( ) and robustness ( ) scores across the 11 independent MAYO-neuron and ROSMAP-neuron Bayesian and predictive networks. Source data is provided in Supplementary Data 15 [this file7] . 
Source data is provided in Supplementary Data 16 [this file8] . Data frequency distributions and detailed statistical results for this figure are provided in Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] and Supplementary Data 7 [rid=MOESM9] , respectively. 
Data frequency distributions and detailed statistical results of Aβ and tau measurements are included in Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] and Supplementary Data 7 [rid=MOESM9] . We additionally analyzed the overlap of these 10 targets with our DE and -eQTL analyses in MAYO and ROSMAP (Supplementary Data 8 [this file0] and 9 [this file1] , respectively). 
The MAYO dataset includes 278 subjects: 84 with AD, 84 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 80 cognitively normal controls, and 30 with pathologic aging (see Supplementary Note 1 [this file] for more information on diagnostic criteria relevant to this study). We performed rigorous statistical testing to demonstrate that these samples are well balanced with respect to age at death ( -value = 0.57) as well as sex ( -value = 0.24) (Supplementary Fig. 7a, c [this file] ). 
Each sample is associated with a cognitive diagnosis of: not cognitively impaired, mild cognitive impairment, or AD (see Supplementary Note 2 [this file] for more information on diagnostic criteria). 
RNA extraction, library preparation, and sequencing of the temporal cortex samples were conducted at the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility Genome Analysis Core, as previously described (see also Supplementary Note 3 [this file] for more information). 
We observed this variance in the age at death ( -value < 0.05) but found no significant difference in sex among the ROSMAP subjects used in our analysis ( -value = 0.072) (Supplementary Fig. 7b, d [this file] ). To address the imbalanced age distribution, we later performed covariate adjustment for age (together with other covariates, see section ‘Deconvolution of RNAseq data into neuron-specific expression residuals’ below), and we confirmed removal of the effects of age and other confounding variables by variance partition analysis before and after covariate adjustment (Supplementary Fig. 2b, d [this file] ). 
Whole-genome genotyping of MAYO subjects was performed at the Mayo Clinic Medical Genome Facility Genome Analysis Core using the Illumina Infinium HumanOmni2.5-8 Kit (see also Supplementary Note 4 [this file] for more information). See Supplementary Note 5 [this file] for more details regarding MAYO sample exclusion. 
Comparing the variance of normalized gene expression before and after covariate adjustment, we confirmed removal of the effects from confounding variables (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ), allowing us to conclude that the residual results are unbiased and robust against these adjusted covariates. 
First, multi-gene biomarkers derived from various scRNAseq studies in control human brains (Supplementary Data 12 [this file4] ) show no significant overlap among themselves, indicating a lack of robustness and consensus in these biomarkers derived from scRNAseq studies (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Second, PCA analysis shows a prominent overlap of scRNAseq biomarker expression across different cell types in MAYO and ROSMAP AD data, indicating that the majority of scRNAseq-derived biomarker gene expression is convoluted and reflecting potential interactions between different cell types under the AD condition (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c [this file] ; Supplementary Data 12 [this file4] ). Furthermore, there is significant overlap between scRNAseq-derived biomarkers and AD therapeutic targets in the AMP-AD Agora list (Supplementary Fig. 3j, k [this file] ). 
Furthermore, our neuron-specific residual derived from the single-gene biomarker is significantly correlated with pseudo neuron-specific residuals derived from a randomly selected subset of scRNAseq biomarkers (Supplementary Fig. 3h, i [this file] ; Supplementary Note 6 [this file] ), indicating that our neuron-specific residual represents a robust neuronal component in the bulk-tissue RNAseq data for neuron-specific therapeutic target discovery in LOAD. 
Prioritization of key drivers for subsequent assessment was determined by ranking their impact score and robustness score (described in Supplementary Notes 7 [this file] and 8 [this file] , respectively).

Extended Data Fig. 2a [rid=Fig8] details the proportion of participants’ samples analyzed using each sequencing platform, and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] summarizes sample-level sequencing metrics. 
Please see Supplementary Table 1 [this file] for a full list of tumor types and acronyms, categories of actionable findings and additional demographic information. = 300 participants. 
In addition, our analysis was 100% concordant with standard clinical and cytogenetic testing for diagnostic/prognostic variants and fusions (for those with RNA available) in solid tumors, central nervous system (CNS) tumors and leukemias (Supplementary Table 3a [this file] ). For an additional nine participants, our analysis provided further characterization of previous clinical findings (Supplementary Table 3b [this file] ). Nine participants had sequencing findings that were of potential prognostic relevance (category B; Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
Fifty-four percent of participants with tumor analysis ( = 143/264) had sequencing findings that were therapeutically targetable (category C; Figs. 2 [rid=Fig2] and 3a [rid=Fig3] and Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ); within subgroups, this corresponded to 72%, 58% and 46% of patients with a CNS tumor, solid tumor or leukemia/lymphoma, respectively. Thirty-seven (37/62, 60%) participants were treated with a matched targeted agent, 14 of 37 as part of a clinical trial (including one patient through a single-patient study), 15 of 37 through compassionate access, 7 of 37 through commercial access and 1 of 37 though an unknown mechanism (Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ). 
Variant details are depicted in Supplementary Table 5 [this file] . Please see Supplementary Table 1 [this file] for a full list of tumor types and acronyms , The proportion of COSMIC single-substitution signature 3 (BRCAness mutational signature) in the PCAWG dataset compared to KiCS cohort patients with absence or presence of either somatic or germline variants affecting the HR pathway. 
Previously unknown germline likely pathogenic or pathogenic (LP/P) variants in cancer predisposition genes (CPGs) were found in 15% ( = 46/300) of participants, resulting in referral for genetic counseling in 89% of cases and cascade testing and initiation of tumor surveillance for participants and/or their relatives in at least 67% and 37% of cases, respectively (9 participants had unknown surveillance status; Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ). 
Seven additional clinically actionable variants were identified upon retrospective analysis of somatic WGS data that were not detected by cancer panel or RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ). This WGS analysis was also fruitful (Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ) in detecting second hits in tumor-suppressor genes, demonstrating interesting mechanisms of tumor-suppressor inactivation and complex fusion events and highlighting a number of novel variants. 
In our cohort, nearly half of the germline LP/P variants in CPGs (21/46) occurred in genes involved in HRR ( , , , , , , , , , or ; Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ). Detailed analyses of KiCS HR somatic and KiCS HR germline cases are presented in Supplementary Table 8 [this file] . 
Nine percent of participants ( = 22 with 23 tumors) had hypermutant tumors, 9 with a TMB of 5–9.9 mutations per Mb, 7 with a TMB of 10–99.9 mutations per Mb and 6 with ultra-hypermutation (TMB of >100 mutations per Mb; Supplementary Table 9 [this file] ). Only 36% ( = 8) of patients with hypermutant tumors had LP/P germline variants in MMR genes ( = 3 heterozygous, = 1 compound heterozygous, = 4 homozygous; Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ), and one patient had somatic biallelic deleterious variants in MMR genes. 
Through detailed analysis of single-nucleotide variants (SNVs), insertions/deletions (indels) and copy number changes, we determined the proportion of patients with changes in tumor drivers (new drivers, expansion of driver clones, displacement/loss of driver clones or diminished driver clones; Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ). Of 38 patients, 22 showed emergence of a new driver and 9 showed loss of a driver; when considering the subset of these with therapeutic implications, 37% of patients ( = 14) had a change in therapy recommendation as a result of serial sample analysis (Fig. 6a [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ). 
Notably, our analysis also reliably captured every canonical fusion and other clinically relevant markers (for example, amplification in neuroblastoma), while providing further detailed characterization of clinical findings in other cases (Supplementary Table 3a,b [this file] ). 
Retrospective analysis of somatic WGS data in our cohort, using a filtering strategy designed to detect variants that would be overlooked by a panel, identified a small number of additional clinically actionable findings ( = 7; Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ). 
We also conducted a detailed analysis of changes to molecular drivers at the time of relapse (Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] and Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ), which extends findings described in histology-specific cohorts and patient-derived xenograft models and so far has been shown in only very small patient subsets of a few broad precision medicine studies , with limited analysis. 
The sex and age of participants included in various analyses can be determined by referring to Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] and 2 [this file] . 
Tumors were sequenced using a custom pan-cancer DNA panel providing deep coverage for 864 cancer-associated genes (Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ) and with whole-transcriptome (RNA-seq) sequencing and WGS. Paired germline samples were analyzed by panel (with specific use of a CPG list for reporting; Supplementary Table 12 [this file] ) and WGS. 
The panel was designed to capture more than 15,000 exons from 864 genes (Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ) using Agilent SureSelect. 
This analysis included functional characterization of the variant by other published studies, RNA-seq of the patient’s tumor showing aberrant splicing or loss of expression, high TMB or mutational signatures detected in the tumor due to variants in MMR or HRD genes (Extended Data Fig. 9 [rid=Fig15] and Supplementary Table 12 [this file] ). 
Supplementary Table 13 [this file] shows the ability of WGS to detect variants using the panel as a truth set ( = 170 tumors). 
We analyzed the difference in TMB for 170 individual samples (Supplementary Table 14 [this file] ). 
A decision tree was used to filter/prioritize CNVs for actionable gene targets (Supplementary Table 15 [this file] ). 
Prioritization of genic variants from actionable genes (Supplementary Table 15 [this file] ) 
Samples were divided into ‘HR germline’ (germline variants affecting the HR pathway; = 20, 5 of which had multiple sequential samples) and ‘HR somatic’ (somatic HR variants; = 20; 5 of which had multiple samples) (Supplementary Table 8 [this file] ). 
Thirty-eight patients had multiple neoplasms of the same histology in the same individual (Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ).
