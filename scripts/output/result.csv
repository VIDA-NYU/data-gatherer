More details for the distribution of brain 5hmC data can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] – 3 [this file] . 
Of the 2821 DhMRs (606 associated with AD diagnosis, 1542 associated with Aβ load, 1399 associated with PHFtau tangles, annotated to 2642 distinct genes) identified in stage II (replication), about 69% reside in exons, ~15% in intergenic regions, and ~17% in introns (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). Compared to non-AD associated 5hmC regions (total 194,944), AD-associated regions (total 2821) were significantly more likely to coincide with regions related to transcription start site (TSS), transcription states, and enhancer states, but less likely to co-position with regions corresponding to heterochromatin and quiescent states (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] , Supplementary Data 20 [rid=MOESM22] ). 
Of these, 108 AD-associated, 581 Aβ-associated and 135 PHFtau-associated 5hmC regions were positively correlated with gene expression, whereas 65 AD-associated, 240 Aβ-associated and 53 PHFtau-associated 5hmC regions were negatively correlated with gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] , Supplementary Data 22 [rid=MOESM24] ). These genes were clustered into multiple protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). The most significant biological processes and pathways of these functional clusters were associated with mTOR signaling, mediator complex and transcriptional regulation of RNA polymerase transcripts (II and III), SWI/SNF and npBAF complex, γ-secretase complex, DNA replication and repair, etc. (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , Supplementary Data 24 [rid=MOESM26] ). 
At GWAS threshold of 1 × 10 , genetic variants residing in regions harboring AD-associated 5hmC alterations were significantly enriched in DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), transcribed histone modifications, TSS, and transcribed chromatin states, but depleted in repressed chromatin states and H3K27me3 in various tissues such as blood, blood vessel, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), colon, liver, and fetal intestine(Supplementary Figs. 7 [this file] – 9 [this file] ; Supplementary Data 30 [rid=MOESM32] – 32 [rid=MOESM34] ). 
We also performed colocalization analysis using summary statistics from a cell-type specific -eQTL analysis of eight human brain cell types and found that one of the colocalized genes, , is expressed in both astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ) and microglia (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ).",pdf,Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology,XML

All ENCODE accessions used are listed in Supplementary Table S2 [this file] . 
Experiments used from ChIP-Atlas are listed in Supplementary Table S3 [this file] . 
We then calculate the fraction of unique peaks shown in Figure 1 [rid=F1] A and Supplementary Figure S2 [this file] as: 
All ChIP-seq targets and cell types used in Epitome are listed in Supplementary Table S2 [this file] . 
However, Epitome can make predictions in a query cellular context using other assays that measure chromatin accessibility, such as ATAC-seq (see Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] ). 
This maximum genomic distance of 12 kb was determined through hyperparameter search using validation chromosome 7 (See Supplementary Figure S12a [this file] ). Without the CASV, Epitome is not able to provide cell type specific predictions for , as shown in Supplementary Figure S12a [this file] . 
However, ATAC-seq can also be used to compute the CASV (See Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] ). 
Training on multiple cell types allows Epitome to generalize well to new cell types, and allows Epitome to achieve similar precision to methods that see the cell type being evaluated during training ( Supplementary Figures S10 and S11 [this file] ). This procedure is visualized in Supplementary Figure S4 [this file] , where at each iteration, the choice of cell types used in and the cell type used for are rotated through until the model has converged. 
Supplementary Figure S16 [this file] visualizes changes in validation and training loss for a subset of 18 ChIP-seq targets in a joint Epitome model trained for 2000 iterations, where training loss is calculated as the mean sigmoid cross entropy across 10 000 randomly selected training regions, and the validation loss is calculated as the mean sigmoid cross entropy across all 200 bp regions on chromosome 7 that have epigenetic signal from at least one of the 18 ChIP-seq targets. 
For Epitome, we found 5 and 0 to be the most optimal patience and min-delta, respectively, after tuning and comparing the hyperparameters shown in Supplementary Figure S15b [this file] . 
Supplementary Figure S15a [this file] compares the model accuracy (auPRC) with and without the early stopping method on 85 ChIP-seq targets. 
Information regarding each algorithm and the features used for each method are listed in Supplementary Table S1 [this file] . We compared these methods by predicting binding sites for 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers in 40 held out cell lines, tissues, and primary cells, enumerated in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . 
We additionally used motifs published by Kheradpour ( 50 [rid=B50] ), available at http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/ (http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/) (See Supplementary Table S5 [this file] for a list of motifs used). 
All combinations considered are listed in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . In total, we trained 323 DeFCoM models. auPRC and pAUC scores for both methods can be found in Supplementary Table S7 [this file] . 
Therefore, we only compare Epitome and DeFCoM in regions overlapping motifs, shown in Figure 2 [rid=F2] B and Supplementary Figure S8 [this file] . 
This is demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] , which shows comparisons of pAUC and auPRC when evaluated on all 200 bp regions on chromosomes 8 and 9. While it is generally a simple classification problem to predict nonbinding in genomic loci with no measured regulatory activity, it is harder to predict nonbinding in regions that have some epigenetic signal. pAUC and auPRC values used to generate Figure 2 [rid=F2] using this sampling technique on chromosomes 8 and 9 can be found in Supplementary Table S8 [this file] . Example ROC and PR curves are shown in Supplementary Figure S9 [this file] . 
We used all motifs as those used to train DeFCoM, available in Cis-BP database and Kheradpour ( 49 [rid=B49] , 50 [rid=B50] ) ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). 
Evaluations of Epitome and DeepSEA are shown in Supplementary Figures S10 and S11 [this file] . We selected all 200 bp regions for evaluation as defined in Defining the test set to compare Epitome, Catchitt and Avocado. pAUC and auPRC values used to generate Supplementary Figure S10 [this file] can be found in Supplementary Table S9 [this file] . 
Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] shows the ratio of ChIP-seq peaks that do not overlap any motif for a TF or chromatin modifier of interest. We considered all motifs specified in Supplementary Table S5 [this file] . TFs, chromatin modifiers, and cell types evaluated are listed in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . Ratios used to generate Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] can be found in Supplementary Table S10 [this file] . 
Heatmaps shown in Supplementary Figure S12 [this file] were generated using Seaborn ( 53 [rid=B53] ). 
Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] shows that Epitome models that are trained on DNase-seq and validated using ATAC-seq perform comparably when validated using DNase-seq. 
listed in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . 
We therefore compared Epitome and DeFCoM by evaluating the ability of each method to predict TFBS overlapping motifs for 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers across 40 cell lines, primary cells, and tissues ( Supplementary Table S6 [this file] ). 
This is demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] , which shows that the ratio of ChIP-seq peaks that do not overlap any motif for a TF in question can range from 0.45 to 1.0 for the 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers we evaluated (see Evaluation of motif overlap of ChIP-seq peaks for 77 transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in 40 cell types). To compare to these methods, we first evaluated chromosome wide predictions of Epitome, Avocado, and Catchitt, on all 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers across 40 cell lines, primary cells, and tissues ( Supplementary Figure S6 [this file] ) on held-out chromosomes 8 and 9 in Figure 2A [rid=F2] , for a total of 264 comparisons. While joint Epitome models perform similarly in terms of pAUC and better for many instances in terms of auPRC compared to single Catchitt models ( Supplementary Figure S6a [this file] ), Avocado performs poorest on these metrics (Figure 2A [rid=F2] ). Supplementary Figure S6b [this file] additionally shows that for many cases, single Epitome models perform better than jointly trained Epitome models. As shown in Supplementary Figure S16 [this file] , different ChIP-seq targets trained in a joint model converge at different iterations during training. 
Supplementary Figure S10 [this file] shows that even though DeepSEA trains using a given test cell line and Epitome does not, Epitome performs comparably to DeepSEA in both pAUC and auPRC. Supplementary Figure S11 [this file] show receiver operating characteristic curves and precision-recall curves for these methods in all four held out cell lines from ENCODE. 
This observation is most easily observed in change in AUC as wider genomic contexts are considered, shown in Supplementary Figure S12a [this file] . Supplementary Figure S12b and c [this file] shows that when histone modifications are trained on more than 10 cell types, performance decreases as wider genomic contexts are considered. 
This is also a common use case that a query cellular context has been partially characterized with multiple experiments, including chromatin accessibility and various histone modifications ( Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] ). 
Although the Epitome model primarily uses DNase-seq to compute the CASV and train its models, we show in Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] that Epitome can accurately predict histone modifications and TFBS when using ATAC-seq during evaluation in the CASV when Epitome has been trained using DNase-seq. 
Figure 5D [rid=F5] and Supplementary Figure S13a [this file] show Epitome predictions for H3K27ac at 72 h in peak and non-peak regions respectively. 
Figure 1 [rid=F1] A and Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] similarly show that across 152 ChIP-seq and DNase-seq experiments, the fraction of unique peaks discovered in each cell type used in Epitome decreases as more cell types are characterized for a given experiment. 
These results are shown in Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] , and show that many histone modifications, including H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, are frequently collected, along with at least one other additional ChIP-seq target of interest. 
As shown in Figure 2 [rid=F2] and Supplementary Figure S6b [this file] , models that are trained individually on epigenetic events of interest often outperform models trained jointly.",zip,Epitome: predicting epigenetic events in novel cell types with multi-cell deep ensemble learning,XML
