Nine of these proteins (Supplementary Table 4) showed higher expression in the rE4 treatment group than in the rE3 group (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] D).

Surprisingly, reducing caveolin-1 expression significantly decreased ABCA1-mediated cholesterol efflux (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] G) despite an increase in total ABCA1 protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] F). Furthermore, overexpression of caveolin-1 in astrocytes enhanced cholesterol efflux (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] G).

Indeed, the two groups showed distinct global patterns of pseudogene expression ( Supplementary Fig. 2 [href=this file] ). For each cancer type, we observed generally weak correlations between the expression level of pseudogenes and their WT genes, which is consistent with the previous study ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [href=this file] ). As observed in Kalyana-Sundaram et al. (2012) , we detected some tumor-lineage-specific pseudogenes (296 from the paired-end group and 41 from the single-end group, Supplementary Fig. 4 [href=this file] ). In addition, for three cancer types with available RNA-seq data from nontumor tissue samples, we identified differentially expressed pseudogenes between tumor and nontumor samples (54 in BRCA, 110 in KIRC and 138 in LUSC, Supplementary Fig. 5 [href=this file] ).
For several cancer types with established tumor subtypes, we performed the supervised analysis and revealed substantial numbers of pseudogenes with significant differential expression: 48 in UCEC (endometrioid vs. serous) , 138 in LUSC (basal, classical, primitive and secretory) , 71 in GBM (classical, mesenchymal, neural and proneural) and 547 in BRCA (PAM50 subtypes: luminal A, luminal B, basal-like, Her2-enriched and normal-like) (Methods, Fig. 2a [href=#F2] , Supplementary Data 1 [href=this file] ).
The predictive power of pseudogene expression is comparable to those achieved by the mRNA expression profiles, suggesting that both pseudogene and mRNA expression can classify the UCEC subtypes independently ( Supplementary Fig. 6 [href=this file] ).
Based on the NMF consensus clustering, 837 BRCA samples can be classified into three distinct subtypes: subtype 1 ( = 144), subtype 2 ( = 390), and subtype 3 ( = 303) ( Fig. 4b [href=#F4] , Supplementary Data 2 [href=this file] ).
Based on the 500 pseudogenes with the most variable expression, we were able to classify 446 KIRC samples into two distinct subtypes ( Fig. 5a [href=#F5] , Supplementary Data 3 [href=this file] ). We observed an enrichment of pseudogenes (115 out of 500) with a statistically significant P-value ( < 0.05) ( Fig. 5c [href=#F5] , Supplementary Data 4 [href=this file] ).
To further assess the clinical utility of the observed pseudogene-expression subtypes, we classified the KIRC samples into four risk quartiles based on the risk scores (in terms of overall survival) calculated from the multivariate Cox model, employing only clinical variables: low risk group (Q1, = 110), low-medium risk group (Q2, = 111), medium-high risk group (Q3, = 112), and high risk group (Q4, = 112) (Methods, Supplementary Data 3 [href=this file] ).
To gain some mechanistic insight into how expressed pseudogenes contribute to the observed KIRC pseudogene-expression subtypes, we performed a systematic analysis ( Supplementary Fig. 9a and Supplementary Data 5 [href=this file] ). Among the WT cognate genes with strong positive correlations with their pseudogenes, we noticed that the survival correlations of individual WT genes with prognostic value match the survival pattern of the pseudogene-expression subtypes: WT genes with better prognosis (potentially tumor suppressors, hazard ratio < 1) show higher expression levels in subtype 1 (the better survival group) and the genes with worse prognosis (potentially oncogenes, hazard ratio > 1) show higher expression levels in subtype 2 (the worse survival group, Supplementary Fig. 8b [href=this file] ). Finally, we examined the classic miRNA decoy model as proposed in Poliseno et al. (2010) and identified 38 such candidates ( Methods and Supplementary Data 5 [href=this file] ). One candidate of interest is the potential regulation of a putative tumor suppressor α-catenin (CTNNA1) by the pseudogene PGOHUM00000257111 through competition for up to 9 shared miRNA regulators ( Supplementary Data 5 [href=this file] ). Indeed, the expression levels of PGOHUM00000257111 were significantly higher in cluster 1 (t-test P = 1.48×10-7), which may lead to the elevated levels of CTNNA1 in subtype 1 ( Supplementary Fig. 8b [href=this file] ) and therefore better survival.
Finally, we performed feature selection ( Supplementary Data 6 [href=this file] ) and built the classifier from the whole training set using the best-performing algorithm (with the highest AUC) identified through the cross-validation, and applied it to the test set in order to independently validate the predictive power.

Meanwhile, we find that deep learning methods are robust for the cross-protocol prediction, while the performance of some statistical methods will drop if the reference and pseudo-bulk data type (UMI to counts or counts to UMI) are exchanged (Supplementary Figs. 1 [this file] and 2 [this file] ). 
Detailed comparison results are available in Supplementary Table 8 [this file] . For the “similar” scenario, we investigated TAPE’s performance on distinguishing similar cell types (CD4 T cell and CD8 T cell) in all the three PBMC datasets (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). With 13 defined cell subtypes (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ), all the methods can not achieve satisfying results (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , median CCC < 0.1), which clearly shows the common limitation of current methods. 
In Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , the two colors stand for the different methods, and the two coordinates of each dot represent overall MAE and CCC for all cell types respectively. 
From the results (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ), we can have four conclusions: (1) TAPE’s predictive power is better than CIBERSORTx when the randomly selected DEGs are less than 1000; (2) both methods can achieve good performance when the DEGs are signature genes and there are not any similar cell types; (3) both methods can not distinguish DEGs from CD8 T cell rather than CD4 T cell if the DEGs are randomly selected; (4) CIBERSORTx is better than TAPE if the DEGs are signature genes and there exist similar cell types. 
The results show that TAPE only predicts and as DEGs in NK cell and no DEGs for other cell types (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
Firstly, when we study the correlation at the gene level using “overall” mode (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ), about 30% of the predicted genes have the negative correlation. However, this phenomenon can also be observed in CIBERSORTx (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), which indicates the information loss between bulk samples and inferred cell-type-specific GEP is hard to be reconstructed. Thirdly, we notice that both CIBERSORTx and our method can not distinguish DEGs from similar cell subtypes correctly if the DEGs are not signature genes (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ) which means that their resolution is still limited. But CIBERSORTx has displayed its advantages in distinguishing signature DEGs from similar cell types because of the incorporation of the signature matrix (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ). 
When we used it to test whether deconvolution methods can achieve good performance with immune cell subtypes, we merged all 30 cell types into 13 cell subtypes (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
This step is very important, because TAPE will fail in predicting test bulk data proportions properly without proper filtering (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] and Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ) . If the less variable genes are not filtered out, TAPE can not predict a good result because of the noises (Supplementary Table 2 [this file] and Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ).

To reveal heterogeneity within oligodendrocytes, we grouped the aforementioned oligodendrocytes into six classes described in a published database , as follows (Fig. 1a [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] –d and 3a [this file] ): (1) Differentiation-committed oligodendrocyte precursors (COPs) and newly formed oligodendrocytes (NFOL) that express Sox6, Pdgfra, and Cspg4. (2) Myelin-forming oligodendrocytes (MFOL) that express Ctps, Ablims, and Thbs3. (3) Mature oligodendrocytes 1, 2 (MOL 1, 2) that express Il33, Ptgds, and Opalin. (4) Mature oligodendrocytes 3, 4 (MOL 3, 4) that express Klk6, S100b, Anxa5, Cd59a and Mgst3. Moreover, we discovered an additional oligodendrocyte cluster, which gradually increased in the 3-, 6-month-old App KI mice (Fig. 1b–d [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). This cluster was present in the UMAP plot even with down-sampled data (400, 1,200, and 2,400 cells) (Supplementary Fig. 2f [this file] ). Remarkably, we found that this cluster shared some signatures with MOL2, while Alzheimer’s disease risk factors such as C4b, Apoe and Cd74 are strongly expressed (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] , 3a [this file] , 3b [this file] , and Source data file). 
We further confirmed the lineage transitions of DAOs and homeostatic MOLs from COP and NFOL in control and AD brains (Fig. 1e–g [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ), but density from the DAO cluster exclusively appeared in 3 and 6-month-old AD brains (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] g). 
We reanalyzed previously published single-cell transcriptome datasets from postmortem AD brains (Supplementary Fig. 5a–c [this file] ) . 
Notably, consistent with scRNA-seq results, we observed a significant increase in Mbp + , Cd74+ oligodendrocytes in 3- and 6-month-old App KI and 6-month-old 5xFAD mice, whereas the number of NeuroD1+ post-mitotic neurons significantly decreased (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] a, b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 6a–c [this file] , and Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] , b [this file] ). We further confirmed an increase in Cd74+ and Oligo2+ AD-associated oligodendrocytes in App KI mice using flow cytometry (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] c, d [rid=Fig2] , and Supplementary Fig. 6d [this file] ). 
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that 6-month-old App KI mice exhibited a thinner myelin layer relative to the axon diameter (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] and supplementary fig. 8 [this file] ). 
Consistently, we found a significant increase in Mbp+ and Cd74+ DAOs in the hippocampus of premature progeria (6-month-old) and 13-month-old mice (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d [this file] ), whereas the number of NeuroD1-positive post-mitotic neurons decreased in the hippocampus of 13-month-old mice (Supplementary Fig. 9e and f [this file] ). We further confirmed that the genes enriched in DAOs were highly correlated with gene signatures shown in the aged human brain (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b [this file] ), indicating that Cd74-positive DAOs increased in the aged brains and had transcriptional profiles more similar to the aged human brain. 
In particular, we found significant alternations in the transcriptional profiles between DAOs and MOL 3/4 clusters and GO-term of up-regulated genes in DAO versus MOL3/4 showed the interleukin & chemokine production and ERK signaling (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] a and c [rid=Fig3] ), which was also confirmed during the disease progression in AD mice brain (Supplementary Fig. 11a, b [this file] ). 
We first identified microglia with a high DAM module score based on previously published DAM signatures (Supplementary Fig. 1e [this file] , 12a, b [this file] ), that gradually increased during AD progression (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] e, f [rid=Fig3] , and Supplementary Fig. 12c [this file] ). 
Supplementary Fig. 13a–c [this file] shows efficient inhibition of phosphor 44/42 MAPK signaling in primary oligodendrocytes upon treatment with 200 ng/ml SCH772984, a specific Erk1 and Erk2 inhibitor. Remarkably, oligodendrocytes treated with SCH772984 exhibited a significant increase in Mbp+ branching compared with the controls, whereas the number of Cd74+ cells significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 13d [this file] , 13e [this file] , and Fig. 4a–c [rid=Fig4] ). 
First, in order to examine the potential interactions between DAOs and other neuronal cell types, AD DAOs were co-cultured with AD neurons, astrocytes, and microglia treated with SCH772984 (Supplementary Fig. 14a [this file] ). We found that AD DAOs with other neuronal cell types did not increase the number of Mbp+ branches in the presence and absence of SCH772984 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 14b–f [this file] ), suggesting that inhibition of ERK/MAPK signaling in other neuronal cell types did not contribute to the phenotypic changes in DAOs (Fig. 4d–f [rid=Fig4] ). Moreover, to investigate whether other neural cell types can contribute to the AD-associated phenotypes via ERK signaling, each of the neurons, microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes isolated from AD mice were subjected to SCH772984 treatment, and AD pathology was determined after co-culture with the remaining untreated AD neuronal cell types (Supplementary Fig. 15a [this file] ). Remarkably, we found that ERK1/2-inhibited oligodendrocytes significantly diminished the Aβ42/40 ratio in the AD primary neuronal cultures (Supplementary Fig. 15b [this file] ). Also, we observed a decrease in the amyloidogenic processing marker C99 in the AD neuronal cultures with SCH772984 treatment (Supplementary Fig. 15c–e [this file] ), indicating that AD oligodendrocytes predominantly contribute to the pathophysiology of AD via ERK signaling. 
Consistent with previous results, systemic administration of SCH772984 significantly reduced the occurrence of DAOs in the hippocampus of App KI mice (Fig. 5b, c [rid=Fig5] , and Supplementary Fig. 16a–d [this file] ) but not Cd74 + Iba1+ microglia (Supplementary Fig. 16c, d [this file] ). 
Moreover, we confirmed a decrease in the number of Aβ plaques (Fig. 5m, n [rid=Fig5] ), coupled with an increase in the number of NeuroD1+ cells in the SCH772984-treated AD mouse hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 16e, f [this file] ).

For LDL cholesterol, which had the best-powered GWAS of the three traits we considered, we identified 38 protein pairs with a significant co-expression effect ( Supplementary Figure 2 [this file] ). 
By visualizing significant COWAS pairs as a network, we identified complexes of mutually interacting proteins that modulate LDL cholesterol levels ( Supplementary Figure 3 [this file] ). For example, we found that APOE and PLTP both decrease LDL cholesterol levels, while their co-expression is associated with increased LDL cholesterol levels ( Supplementary Figure 4 [this file] ). 
Effect sizes, standard errors, and values for the pairs shown in Figure 3 [rid=F3] are also summarized in Supplementary Table 1 [this file] . 
Results for protein pairs identified as significant using at least one of these three tests with IGAP GWAS data are shown in Supplementary Figure 5 [this file] and Supplementary Table 2 [this file] . 
Finally, we considered an alternative, product-based formulation of COWAS (see Supplementary Note 1 [this file] for details). The mean out-of-sample for product-based co-expression imputation models was slightly higher than for any of the residual-based co-expression imputation models, and over 99% of well-imputed pairs again had a nominally significant correlation between imputed and observed expression ( Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] and Supplementary Data 1 [rid=SD2] ). 
We also discovered 22 pairs with an overall effect on AD using the product-based COWAS global test and EADB summary statistics ( Supplementary Figure 7 [this file] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). Full results for AD using the product-based version of COWAS are provided in Supplementary Figure 7 [this file] , Supplementary Table 3 [this file] , and Supplementary Data 18 [rid=SD2] – 19 [rid=SD2] .

Among these well-imputed pairs, lasso regression with -pQTLs pre-screened by their effect sizes achieved the highest mean out-of-sample for predicting co-expression (mean , Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). On the other hand, ridge regression with both -pQTLs and -pQTLs pre-screened by their values yielded the greatest number of well-imputed protein pairs ( Figure 2d [rid=F2] and Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ).

More details for the distribution of brain 5hmC data can be found in Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] – 3 [this file] . 
Of the 2821 DhMRs (606 associated with AD diagnosis, 1542 associated with Aβ load, 1399 associated with PHFtau tangles, annotated to 2642 distinct genes) identified in stage II (replication), about 69% reside in exons, ~15% in intergenic regions, and ~17% in introns (Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] ). Compared to non-AD associated 5hmC regions (total 194,944), AD-associated regions (total 2821) were significantly more likely to coincide with regions related to transcription start site (TSS), transcription states, and enhancer states, but less likely to co-position with regions corresponding to heterochromatin and quiescent states (Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] , Supplementary Data 20 [rid=MOESM22] ). 
Of these, 108 AD-associated, 581 Aβ-associated and 135 PHFtau-associated 5hmC regions were positively correlated with gene expression, whereas 65 AD-associated, 240 Aβ-associated and 53 PHFtau-associated 5hmC regions were negatively correlated with gene expression (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] , Supplementary Data 22 [rid=MOESM24] ). These genes were clustered into multiple protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). The most significant biological processes and pathways of these functional clusters were associated with mTOR signaling, mediator complex and transcriptional regulation of RNA polymerase transcripts (II and III), SWI/SNF and npBAF complex, γ-secretase complex, DNA replication and repair, etc. (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] , Supplementary Data 24 [rid=MOESM26] ). 
At GWAS threshold of 1 × 10 , genetic variants residing in regions harboring AD-associated 5hmC alterations were significantly enriched in DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs), transcribed histone modifications, TSS, and transcribed chromatin states, but depleted in repressed chromatin states and H3K27me3 in various tissues such as blood, blood vessel, embryonic stem cells (ESCs), colon, liver, and fetal intestine(Supplementary Figs. 7 [this file] – 9 [this file] ; Supplementary Data 30 [rid=MOESM32] – 32 [rid=MOESM34] ). 
We also performed colocalization analysis using summary statistics from a cell-type specific -eQTL analysis of eight human brain cell types and found that one of the colocalized genes, , is expressed in both astrocytes (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ) and microglia (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ).",pdf,Brain 5-hydroxymethylcytosine alterations are associated with Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology,XML,,,,,,,

For trials reporting event-free survival data (e.g., PFS; Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ) median = 0.950 (Q1 = 0.909, mean: 0.929, Q3 = 0.970) as compared to a theoretical maximal = 0.996, which corresponds to 5% of observed variance not explained by the Weibull model. This is illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 2a, b [this file] for Weibull fits to OS and PFS data for panitumumab in combination with FOLFIRI and for FOLFIRI alone in wild-type and mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (trial 20050181 ; average = 0.99 for OS curves and 0.92 for PFS curves). 
Across the entire data set, some of the worst fits for two-parameter Weibull forms were observed for trials with relatively few events, for example, the Chronicle trial ( NCT00427713 (NCT00427713) ) with only eight deaths in the treatment arm and 16 progression events in the observation arm (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] ; Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
For a small number of trials in which the asymptote of the fitted survival curve was greater than zero (i.e., patients were expected to be alive at the end of the longest follow-up), a three-parameter Weibull distribution consisting of the traditional two-parameter distribution with an additional “cure rate” term had an improved fit (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). 
This is potentially consistent with a two-population hypothesis (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Moreover, a mixture model exhibited no meaningful improvement in fit as compared to a single-distribution for OS data from ICI or control arms in these trials (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). This generated the steep decline in PFS values observable in the control and experimental arms of actual ICI trials, and improved fit to PFS distributions, raising mean from 0.93 to 0.98 (Fig. 3c [rid=Fig3] ; Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ; “Methods”). 
A challenge in the analysis of such data is that, when too few events have occurred, nonparametric numeric confidence estimates return non-informative values (usually reported as a value “not reached” or “indeterminate” as illustrated for two different scenarios in Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). We found that 12-month survival estimates were non-informative for 20–40% of OS trial arms, and 23–61% of event-free survival trial arms, with higher failure rates occurring when the sample size was smaller (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c [this file] ). 
For event-free survival (for which 99 event-free survival curves could be compared), the precision of a Weibull-based approach was also greater than a nonparametric approach across all sample sizes, while accuracy was equivalent for small sample sizes (fewer than 40 patients) (Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] ). 
Thus, parametric fitting of data from 15 patients made a comparably precise and accurate estimate of median PFS as nonparametric analysis of 60 patients (Supplementary Fig. 6b [this file] ). 
We observed that for a representative simulation, a two-parameter Weibull form accurately described the synthetic trial data ( = 0.98; Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
Parameter values for trials reporting event-free survival followed a similar pattern to OS values (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] and Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ). 
A similar pattern was observed for event-free survival data, with control and experimental values differing by 1.0% for unsuccessful trials and 36% for successful trials (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
For event-free survival data, 155 comparisons of experimental and control arms from 146 trial figures revealed a range of Δ values from +0.55 to −0.85 (median |Δ | = 0.08) (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ).

S2 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ), we retained 654 samples with matched genotype and cortical RNA-seq data spanning 4-39 PCW, the majority falling within the first two trimesters (Tri1, n=216; Tri2, n=433; Table S1 [this file] ). S3 [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). 
Compared with adult brain eQTL datasets from PsychENCODE ( 13 [rid=R13] , 14 [rid=R14] ) and GTEx ( 16 [rid=R16] ), we identified 2,488 unique “fetal-specific” eGenes in this dataset ( Fig. 1B [rid=F1] ; Table S1 [this file] ). S3 [this file] ). S3 [this file] ), suggesting that these context-specific annotations may be more relevant for interpretation of neuropsychiatric GWAS signals, which are known to be under negative selection.

As expected, -xQTL are strongly clustered near their target genes’ transcription start site (TSS) ( Fig. 1E [rid=F1] ) and are correspondingly enriched in functional regions of the genome ( Fig. 1F [rid=F1] ; Table S1 [this file] ). To investigate the variant-level overlap among -e/iso/sQTLs, we calculated Storey’s pi1 statistic ( 40 [rid=R40] ) and found that genetic variants directly associated with RNA splicing (especially isoQTL) capture independent and additional signals from eQTLs ( Fig. 1H [rid=F1] ; Methods [this file] ). 
S3 [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ), we identified multiple independent regulatory signals for 3,570 eGenes in the fetal brain, with some exhibiting up to 10 groups of conditionally independent -eQTL signals. Each CS prioritized a median of 5 SNPs, with 2,423 containing exactly one SNP, which are strong candidates for functional validation ( Data S1 [this file] ). 
S6 [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). 
S2 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ), we inferred genetic ancestries in the fetal brain samples in reference to the 1000 Genomes ( 44 [rid=R44] ). S1 [this file] ; Table S1 [this file] ). Following the multi-ancestry QTL mapping pipeline, we independently mapped xQTLs in the three largest ancestry groupings: EUR, AMR, and AFR. 986 eGenes were shared between the multi-ancestry dataset and the three ancestry groupings ( Fig. 2B [rid=F2] ; Table S2 [this file] ). We then performed statistical fine-mapping separately in the ancestry groupings ( 42 [rid=R42] ), and show that AFR, despite of the smallest sample size, has on average the smallest credible sets (CS) of causal variants ( Fig. 2D [rid=F2] ; Data S2 [this file] , S3 [this file] , S4 [this file] ). 
S7 [this file] ; Table S3 [this file] ). Mirroring eQTL results, we found that heritability drops significantly from Tri1 to Tri2 ( Fig. 3C [rid=F3] ; Wilcoxon p < 2.2e-16; Table S3 [this file] ; Data S5 [this file] , S6 [this file] ).

We generated continuous annotations for genetic variants based on fine-mapping posterior probabilities ( 51 [rid=R51] ) and found SCZ GWAS signals to be highly enriched among fetal brain regulatory elements -- more so than in the adult brain ( Fig. 4B [rid=F4] ; Table S4 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S9 [this file] ; Table S4 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S9 [this file] ; Table S4 [this file] ). 
Across these traits, we consistently observed greater heritability mediated by isoform regulation (isoform h /h 6.45±1.92%) than that of gene expression (3.15±1.25%) or splicing (2.13±1.74%), although the overall extent of mediation remains small ( Fig. 4C [rid=F4] ; Table S4 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). Extending these analyses across trimester-specific annotations, although less well powered, pointed to isoform-regulation in Tri2 as being particularly important, especially for BIP ( Fig. 4D [rid=F4] ; Table S4 [this file] ).

Other novel disease mechanisms prioritized by these analyses include: downregulation of the GABA -receptor subunit in SCZ (eQTL: rs514733, CLPP=0.32; Fig. 5B [rid=F5] ; Table S5 [this file] ), providing genetic evidence for GABAergic dysfunction hypothesized to contribute to disease pathophysiology ( 60 [rid=R60] ); splicing dysregulation of in BIP (top colocalization sQTL: rs11750832, CLPP=0.97; Fig. S10 [this file] ; Table S5 [this file] ) which encodes adenylate cyclase, a cell membrane-bound enzyme regulating cAMP signaling and a target of the mood stabilizer lithium ( 61 [rid=R61] ); splicing dysregulation in BIP of (sQTL: rs17183814, CLPP=0.70; Fig. S10 [this file] ; Table S5 [this file] ), a voltage gated sodium channel subunit with rare variant associations in ASD and epilepsy ( 62 [rid=R62] , 63 [rid=R63] ); and in MDD, the dysregulated splicing of (CLPP=0.43; Fig. S10 [this file] ; Table S5 [this file] ), a highly constrained E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase and regulator of N6-methyladenosine RNA modification involved in neural-immune activation ( 64 [rid=R64] ). 
We next conducted an isoform-centric transcriptome-wide association study (isoTWAS) ( 65 [rid=R65] ), to identify genes and their isoforms whose regulated expression is associated with SCZ risk. isoTWAS identified 536 isoforms across 271 unique genes with significant isoTWAS associations (Bonferroni-corrected P < 0.05 across genes, FWER-corrected P < 0.05 across transcripts of the same gene, permutation P < 0.05; Methods [this file] ). To leverage local LD and to account for SNP weight correlations, we performed fine-mapping on isoTWAS associations that passed permutation testing ( Fig. 5D [rid=F5] ; Table S5 [this file] ). 
Among 14 TWAS-identified genes with >3 conditionally independent eQTLs, the MRLocus framework provided additional support for 7 genes with FDR<0.2 ( Table S5 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S11 [this file] ). 
In total, we identified 124 gene and isoform co-expression modules demonstrating enrichment for all major developmental cell types ( 36 [rid=R36] ) and recapitulating early biochemical processes and developmental pathways ( Fig. 6A [rid=F6] ; Methods [this file] ). 
Overlaying enrichment for common and rare variation within the hierarchical structure defined by co-expression pinpointed groups of modules that harbor most of neurodevelopmental disease risk ( Fig. 6B [rid=F6] ; Table S6 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). S12 [this file] ).

S12 [this file] ) displayed robust BIP, education attainment (EA), and SCZ enrichment while harboring high risk hub genes like and – similar to the prenatally-enriched M37 module described in Li et al ( 18 [rid=R18] ). S12 [this file] ). 
CellWalker mapped 21.7% of eQTL-containing genes to a specific cellular context in the developing human brain, corresponding to 3,739 of the bulk-derived eQTLs ( Fig. 7A [rid=F7] ; Table S7 [this file] ; Methods [this file] ). To identify such ieQTLs, in which SNP-gene associations are modulated by the levels of a given module, we tested the interaction effect between genotype and module eigengenes on gene and isoform expression ( Fig. 7B [rid=F7] ; Methods [this file] ). Across all gene and isoform modules, 8,008 ieQTLs were identified after the permutation test (BH-corrected FDR<0.05; Methods [this file] ), in which 3,960 ieQTLs were specific to a single module ( Fig. 7C [rid=F7] ; Data S9 [this file] ). Finally, integrating disease GWAS, we identified significant colocalizations (CLPP>0.01) between ieQTLs and 22 SCZ GWAS loci, 13 of which are not found with bulk cA-eQTLs ( Table S5 [this file] ).

The analysis split ADNI participants into two clusters, 2 and 3, at the top of the tree, with significantly different levels of p-tau in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), glucose uptake measured by [ F] fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), and the 13-item AD assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog. 13; Fig. 2b [rid=F2] - d [rid=F2] , Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). All associations remained significant ( Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ). 
Specifically, we examined acylcarnitine-related SNPs reported by Shin et al. as non-modifiable factors (SNP list is provided in Supplementary Table 5 [this file] , replication in ADNI in Supplementary Table 6 [this file] ) and modifiable acylcarnitine levels (i.e., residuals adjusted for genetic and other non-modifiable factors) to better understand their impact on subgroup separation. 
Genetic influences only accounted for a small proportion of variance ( Supplementary Table 7 [this file] - 9 [this file] ), except for one epistatic interaction effect of two SNPs: The interplay of rs17806888 (mapped to ) and rs924135 (mapped to ), both of which have been reported to affect succinylcarnitine levels , explained 32% of the initial partitioning of the data into cluster 2 and cluster 3 at the top of the tree ( Fig. 2j [rid=F2] and Supplementary Fig. 2 [rid=SD2] ). When we examined relations to AD, we observed that both single acylcarnitine-related SNPs and epistatic models were not strongly linked to AD and its biomarkers, although some associations were independently confirmed in the MayoLOAD and ROS/MAP studies ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [rid=SD2] and Supplementary Table 10 [this file] ). 
After cross-normalizing the different cohort datasets for better comparability ( Methods [rid=S6] and Supplementary Fig. 4 [rid=SD2] ), we fitted a multivariable linear model that regresses age on the fasting serum levels of acylcarnitines in the KORA cohort ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [rid=SD2] and Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ). When applied to the ADNI cohort, correlation dropped to 28% (cognitively normal participants only), which was very similar to what we observed when replicating the bioenergetic age computation process in AGES-RS (r = 29%, Supplementary Table 12 [this file] ). 
Bioenergetic age highlighted interesting relationships between subgroups and AD pathology throughout the tree ( Supplementary Table 13 [this file] ). This was further confirmed by significant associations of bioenergetic age with AD biomarkers across the A-T-(N)-(C) spectrum ( Supplementary Table 14 [this file] ), and consistent findings for cognitive function and grey matter volume in AGES-RS ( Supplementary Table 15 [this file] ). 
Specifically, bioenergetically younger individuals demonstrated a significantly slower decline over five years ( Supplementary Table 16 [this file] ). This result was replicated using longitudinal diagnosis data from the AGES-RS study ( Fig. 4d [rid=F4] , Supplementary Table 15 [this file] ), providing further evidence that younger bioenergetic age is protective against cognitive decline. 
We selected the grouping that had the most significant associations across three cognitive measures: ADAS-Cog 13, memory, and executive function ( Supplementary Table 17 [this file] ). 
The final dataset contained 140 metabolite measurements, covering 23 acylcarnitine species ( Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ), for 1,531 individuals. 
Data for 22 out of 23 acylcarnitines investigated in ADNI ( Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ) were available here, with the exception being levels of C4:1, which was not reliably measured in KORA. 
We obtained a list of 32 acylcarnitine-associated SNPs ( Supplementary Table 5 [this file] ) from a large GWAS study performed on a total of 7,824 individuals from the KORA and TwinsUK studies . 
To investigate robustness of the model, we performed 10-fold, 3 times repeated cross-validation ( Supplementary Table 11 [this file] ).",xlsx,Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease,XML,,,,,,,

Genetic influences only accounted for a small proportion of variance ( Supplementary Table 7 [rid=SD1] - 9 [rid=SD1] ), except for one epistatic interaction effect of two SNPs: The interplay of rs17806888 (mapped to ) and rs924135 (mapped to ), both of which have been reported to affect succinylcarnitine levels , explained 32% of the initial partitioning of the data into cluster 2 and cluster 3 at the top of the tree ( Fig. 2j [rid=F2] and Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ).

Furthermore, this analysis revealed a strong correlation between bioenergetic age and the first principal component of acylcarnitine levels, indicating that the primary axis of variation in the data and the clustering is associated with bioenergetic age ( Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Rather, we found that individuals within cluster 7 consistently exhibit the same chronological but significantly younger bioenergetic age than other participants irrespective of their diagnostic group ( Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
We attempted to replicate this grouping, which had similar genotype frequencies as in ADNI (59% vs. 58% in ROS/MAP; Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), using trajectories of global cognition over 13 years in the ROS/MAP cohort.",pdf,Individual bioenergetic capacity as a potential source of resilience to Alzheimer’s disease,XML,,,,,,,

As expected, no difference was observed for WBGs between prenatal and postnatal stages ( = 0.27, Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, in GTEx data, we observed that nearest non-HRG genes are highly expressed in a majority of brain tissues while non-nearest HRGs are not ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ).

We also predicted two DNA binding proteins, SOX2 and SATB2 ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ), which have important roles in neurogenesis and have been widely implicated in SCZ. Several of our predicted HRGs are miR-137 target genes, including the aforementioned , and three other genes, and . , a glutamate-gated ion channel protein and a key mediator of synaptic plasticity , has a pdDNM and multiple regulatory connections ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). , encoding Transcription Factor 4, participates in the initiation of neuronal differentiation by regulating the intrinsic excitability of prefrontal cortical neurons , and knockdown of alters the expression of genes important for developing prefrontal neocortex . is also linked with numerous DREs ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ) in iRIGS.

One pdDNM and a high number of regulatory links were observed for ( Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), promoting it as the top gene predicted by iRIGS. 
We curated a list of 2263 confirmed druggable targets from multiple sources ( Methods [rid=S15] ), and found that 28 (27%) HRGs are targets of 198 FDA-approved, clinically investigational, or preclinical drugs ( Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] and Supplementary Table 7 [rid=SD2] ).

We performed iRIGS on these loci to identify risk genes of SCZ ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
We also tried other thresholds to define LBGs, and the enrichment patterns are similar ( Supplementary Table 2 [this file] ). 
We found that NRGs are indeed connected to more DREs in Hi-C and FANTOM5 data ( Fig. 2b [rid=F2] , Supplementary Fig. 1 [rid=SD1] , Methods [rid=S15] , and Supplementary Note [this file] ). 
We therefore integrated them into iRIGS ( Methods [rid=S15] ) and predicted 104 high-confident risk genes (HRGs) in total ( Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
We found that non-nearest HRGs are more significantly enriched in the gene sets compared to nearest non-HRG genes ( Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ), suggesting that the 65 non-nearest HRGs identified by iRIGS are more likely to be true risk genes than their nearest counterparts.

Cells with consistent cell type annotations were combined with the CellRef Seed to form the LungMAP Human Lung CellRef (347,970 cells) (Fig. 2B [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Figs. 1 [this file] – 3 [this file] , “Methods”). 
Using the same approach, we constructed a cell type dictionary based on the LungMAP CellCards to define cell types in mouse lung during perinatal development, identified seed cells for each cell type (termed LungMAP Mouse Lung Development CellRef Seed”), and constructed a CellRef for mouse lung development (denoted as LungMAP Mouse Lung Development CellRef) using Drop-seq of mouse lungs ( = 95,658, 8 time points, 17 samples) from embryonic day 16.5 to postnatal day 28 (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM5] , 4 [rid=MOESM6] ). 
These tools provide highly interactive search, analyzing, and visualization functionalities for users to explore and reanalyze cell type and gene expression patterns provided by the LungMAP CellRefs (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). Users can also select and highlight cells of interest (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Evaluation of the other three test data samples were shown in Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] . 
As shown in Fig. 5D–I [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] , predicted cell types were well separated and formed clusters. Cell-type-specific marker genes from CellCards were selectively expressed in each predicted cell type, supporting the concordance of the cell identities (Fig. 5E, F [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). The median values of all metrics are greater than 0.92 (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), supporting the high consistency of the automated CellRef cell type prediction with the original cell annotations. Both the LungMAP human and mouse lung CellRefs achieved high cross validation performance with ~0.92 median F1 and MCC scores for the human lung CellRef and 0.98 median F1 and MCC scores for the mouse lung CellRef, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
We summarized the one-to-one mapped cell types and the unique cell types/states in the Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] . 
Similarly, when applying these stability metrics to CellRef and HLCA using their own data collections, CellRef produced slightly higher scores on SCCAF and TF-IDF; as well as a significantly higher score on cell re-assignment ( = 0.011) as compared to HLCA (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). scTriangulate leverages the computed stability scores to further assess the marginal importance of each annotation (CellRef and HLCA) using a cooperative game theory framework. scTriangulate predicted that 50% ( = 24/48) of the CellRef cell types to be of higher confidence (AEC, AF1, AF2, AM, ASMC, CD8 T, cDC1, cDC2, Ciliated, Goblet, Ionocyte, LEC, Platelet, pMON, Suprabasal, SVEC, VSMC), compared to 46% ( = 27/58) of the HCLA cell types (AT2, aCAP, Pericyte, Mesothelium, Peribronchial fibroblasts and Adventitial fibroblasts, etc.) (Fig. 8D [rid=Fig8] ). 
The overall distributions of iLISI scores in both CellRef and HLCA are not ideal, on average about 15% for CellRef, and 5% for HLCA, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ), likely due to that both atlases were constructed using large collections of heterogeneous data from different biological regions and conditions rather than a well-designed balanced cohort. Nevertheless, CellRef consistently outperforms HLCA on the measurements of iLISI, and has the cLISI scores close to 1, indicating a well separation of the CellRef cell types (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
Results supported the high accuracy, cluster stability, and marker specificity of our mouse lung reference cell types (Supplementary Fig. 12 [this file] ; mean AUC 95.8, mean SCCAF score: 0.970, mean Reassign score: 0.881, mean TFID10 score: 0.892).",pdf,Guided construction of single cell reference for human and mouse lung,XML,,,,,,,

The resulting “star subnetworks” centered on the hot node ( Supplementary Figure 2 [href=this file] ; Online Methods) contain many neighboring genes that are not mutated at appreciable frequency and are of limited biological interest.
We introduce the HotNet2 (HotNet iffusion riented ubnetworks) algorithm to address the problem of finding significantly mutated subnetworks on large, broad mutation frequency spectrum datasets like Pan-Cancer ( Figure 1c [href=#F1] and Supplementary Figure 3 [href=this file] ). HotNet2 uses a modified diffusion process and considers the source, or directionality, of heat flow in the identification of subnetworks ( Supplementary Figure 4 [href=this file] ).
We combined the resulting subnetworks into 14 consensus subnetworks that were found across different gene scores and networks ( < 0.004, Supplementary Table 3 [href=#SD2] ), plus the condensin complex and CLASP/CLIP proteins ( Supplementary Figure 5 [href=this file] ) that were significant in individual interaction networks ( Supplementary Tables 6,7 [href=#SD2] ). We developed an online interactive viewer (see URLs and Supplementary Figure 6 [href=this file] ) for Pan-Cancer HotNet2 subnetworks.
The subnetworks and linker genes ( Figure 2a [href=#F2] ) include: portions of well-known cancer pathways such as TP53, PI3K, NOTCH, and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; Supplementary Figure 7 [href=this file] ), as well as pathways and complexes that have more recently been observed to be important in cancer such as SWI/SNF complex, BAP1 complex, NFE2L2-KEAP1 ( Supplementary Figures 8,9 [href=this file] ), and RUNX1-CBFB core binding complex ( Supplementary Figure 10 [href=this file] ). The fifth most mutated subnetwork (16.9% of samples) consists of MLL2 and MLL3 and the putative interacting protein KDM6A ( Supplementary Figure 11 [href=this file] ), and was highly mutated (28.9% of samples) in TCGA Pan-Cancer squamous integrated subtype . The MHC Class I subnetwork ( Supplementary Figure 12 [href=this file] ) is an example of the ability of HotNet2 ability to identify rarely mutated cancer genes; all of the genes in the subnetwork are mutated in fewer than 35 samples (1.1%), yet four of the five genes have recently been proposed as novel cancer genes . Additional analyses are in the Supplementary Note [href=this file] .
To obtain additional support for these genes we examined whether they had either an excess of inactivating mutations or a cluster of missense mutations in protein sequence (using NMC ) or in protein structure (using iPAC ; Supplementary Figures 13,14 [href=this file] and Supplementary Tables 21,22 [href=#SD2] ). We find that genes in HotNet2 consensus subnetworks are enriched for inactivating mutations ( < 0.0001) or mutation clusters ( < 0.0001) compared to genes not in subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 6–18 [href=#SD2] and Supplementary Note Section 5.1 [href=this file] ). Finally, we evaluated a subset of the mutations in these genes using RNA-Seq and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the same samples, and found RNA-Seq and/or WGS reads that validated 39 mutations in these novel genes ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 23 [href=#SD2] ).
This exclusivity was largely due to LUAD samples with mutually exclusive and mutations ( Supplementary Figure 15 [href=this file] ).
The three largest subnetworks – including a subnetwork, a subnetwork, and a subnetwork – contain many well-known cancer genes ( Supplementary Tables 8–10 [href=#SD2] and Supplementary Figures 16,17 [href=this file] ).
The subnetwork also includes , which has a significant ( < 8×10 ) cluster of missense mutations ( Supplementary Figure 18 [href=this file] ).
We find that mutations in the SWI/SNF and BAP1 complexes show even greater mutual exclusivity ( =9.4×10 ) in KIRC because of mutations in additional genes in these complexes besides and , respectively ( Supplementary Note Section 5.8.1 [href=this file] ).
Finally, RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing data from the same samples provide further validation of the somatic mutations in , , , , , and and show that some of these mutations are expressed ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 39 [href=#SD2] ).
Our analysis complements other recent Pan-Cancer analyses including studies that analyze only one type of aberration or restrict attention to recurrent aberrations ( Supplementary Note Section 8.3 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 27 [href=#SD2] ).
We selected the threshold of 400 aberrations per sample as the derivative of the number of mutations per sample starts increasing rapidly beyond this value ( Supplementary Figure 19 [href=this file] ). Finally, we used only those genes that had at least 3 reads from RNA-seq data in at least 70% of samples of at least one of the cancer types, as described in The resulting dataset contained aberrations in 11,565 genes and 3110 samples ( Supplementary Figure 1 [href=this file] ). Additional details of the datasets are in the Supplementary Note [href=this file] .
While interaction networks have proven useful in analyzing various types of genomic data , statistically robust identification of significantly mutated subnetworks is a difficult problem with several major challenges ( Supplemental Note Section 1.1 [href=this file] ). HotNet2 addresses these challenges and identifies significantly mutated subnetworks of a genome-scale interaction network, using an insulated heat diffusion process that considers both the scores on individual genes/proteins as well as the topology of interactions between genes/proteins ( Supplementary Figure 3 [href=this file] ).
The insulated heat model can also described in terms of a random walk with restart ( Supplementary Note Section 1.2 [href=this file] ).
Since the diffusion matrix is not symmetric and in general ( ) ≠ ( ), the similarity ( , ) is also not symmetric ( Supplementary Note Section 1.2.1 [href=this file] ).
The statistical test is the same as the two-stage statistical test introduced in the original HotNet algorithm ( Supplementary Note Section 1.3 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figures 20–23 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 28 [href=#SD2] ).
HotNet2 has two parameters β and δ, and selects values for both of these parameters using procedures. β is selected from the protein-protein interaction network, of any gene scores ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.1 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figure 24 [href=this file] , and Supplementary Table 29 [href=#SD2] ). The value of δ is chosen such that large connected components are not found using the observed gene score distribution on random networks with the same degree distribution as the observed network ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.2 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figure 25 [href=this file] , and Supplementary Table 30 [href=#SD2] ).
See Supplementary Figure 2 [href=this file] .
Expanding on this third point, when undirected diffusion algorithms like HotNet or related network propagation algorithms are run on large datasets containing a wide range of gene scores (e.g. the Pan-Cancer dataset), many of the resulting subnetworks are “hot” determined by a single high-scoring node and the immediate neighbors of this node ( Supplementary Figure 2 [href=this file] ).
The HotNet2 subnetworks also have a higher fraction of interactions with proteins other than a hot central node ( Supplementary Note Section 7.1 [href=this file] ). In short, the results show that HotNet2 achieves higher sensitivity and specificity than HotNet ( Supplementary Note Section 7.2 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 26 [href=this file] ).
We find that HotNet2 provides both new insights and a simpler summary of groups of interacting genes, and is a useful complement (or arguably a replacement for) other pathway tests ( Supplementary Note Section 8.1 [href=this file] ). We also show that HotNet2 has much higher specificity than HotNet, DAVID, and GSEA in identifying genes satisfying the 20/20 rule ( Supplementary Note Section 8.1.4 [href=this file] , Supplementary Figure 27 [href=this file] , and Supplementary Tables 34–36 [href=#SD2] ). Finally, we find that HotNet2 was more stable than HotNet in identifying 20/20 genes using cross-validation ( Supplementary Note Section 7.3 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 28 [href=this file] ).
We found that MEMo was unable to run on the Pan-Cancer mutation frequency dataset, consistent with the authors’ recommendation that MEMo should be run only on a small number of significant mutations (details in Supplementary Note Section 8.2 [href=this file] ).
We ran HotNet2 on each combination of gene scores (mutation frequency and MutSigCV -values; see Supplementary Note Section 2.2 [href=this file] ) and interaction networks (HINT+HI2012 , iRefIndex , and Multinet ; Supplementary Note Section 2.5 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 29 [href=this file] ). This procedure is described in Supplementary Note Section 1.5 [href=this file] .
Additional details of the statistical procedure are in Supplementary Note Section 1.3 [href=this file] .
Notable among the additional subnetworks identified when we remove the requirement for RNA-Seq expression is a subnetwork ( Supplementary Table 25 [href=#SD2] ) containing members of the telomerase complex (including and ) that has a well-studied role in cancer ( Supplementary Figure 30 [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 38 [href=#SD2] ).",pdf,Pan-Cancer Network Analysis Identifies Combinations of Rare Somatic Mutations across Pathways and Protein Complexes - PMC,HTML,"(13.8MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/4444046/bin/NIHMS644198-supplement-1.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

We combined the resulting subnetworks into 14 consensus subnetworks that were found across different gene scores and networks ( < 0.004, Supplementary Table 3 [href=this file] ), plus the condensin complex and CLASP/CLIP proteins ( Supplementary Figure 5 [href=#SD1] ) that were significant in individual interaction networks ( Supplementary Tables 6,7 [href=this file] ).
Many of the subnetworks exhibit a significant enrichment for mutations in a subset of cancer types, including many previously unreported associations ( Supplementary Tables 6–18 [href=this file] ). In addition, the HotNet2 Pan-Cancer analysis provides a clearer and more robust summary of subnetworks and novel genes than HotNet2 analysis of individual cancer types ( Supplementary Table 19 [href=this file] ).
These subnetworks and linkers include a total of 147 genes, including many well-known cancer genes and pathways, but also including genes with mutations that are too rare to be significant by the single-gene tests ( Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] ). Table 1 [href=#T1] lists a subset of promising candidates, with the full list and associated references in Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] .
More information on these genes – as well as other candidate driver genes – is in Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] .
To obtain additional support for these genes we examined whether they had either an excess of inactivating mutations or a cluster of missense mutations in protein sequence (using NMC ) or in protein structure (using iPAC ; Supplementary Figures 13,14 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Tables 21,22 [href=this file] ). We find that genes in HotNet2 consensus subnetworks are enriched for inactivating mutations ( < 0.0001) or mutation clusters ( < 0.0001) compared to genes not in subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 6–18 [href=this file] and Supplementary Note Section 5.1 [href=#SD1] ). Finally, we evaluated a subset of the mutations in these genes using RNA-Seq and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from the same samples, and found RNA-Seq and/or WGS reads that validated 39 mutations in these novel genes ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 23 [href=this file] ).
Multiple pairs of genes within these subnetworks show co-occurring mutations ( Supplementary Table 24 [href=this file] ). We observe significant mutual exclusivity within 4 of our subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 25 [href=this file] ).
The three largest subnetworks – including a subnetwork, a subnetwork, and a subnetwork – contain many well-known cancer genes ( Supplementary Tables 8–10 [href=this file] and Supplementary Figures 16,17 [href=#SD1] ).
HotNet2 Pan-Cancer analyses also revealed a number of novel genes ( Supplementary Table 20 [href=this file] ) within these three subnetworks.
The sixth most mutated HotNet2 Pan-Cancer subnetwork (16.8% of samples) includes multiple members of the SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complex ( Figure 3a [href=#F3] and Supplementary Table 12 [href=this file] ).
Another HotNet2 Pan-Cancer subnetwork (mutated in 7.1% of samples) overlaps the BAP1 complex ( Figure 3b [href=#F3] and Supplementary Table 13 [href=this file] ).
HotNet2 Pan-Cancer analysis identifies 4/5 members of the cohesin complex as a significantly mutated subnetwork (7.3% of samples, Figure 4a [href=#F4] and Supplementary Table 15 [href=this file] ).
The combined subnetwork is mutated in 4.2% of samples ( Figure 4b [href=#F4] and Supplementary Table 6 [href=this file] ). Finally, RNA-seq and whole-genome sequencing data from the same samples provide further validation of the somatic mutations in , , , , , and and show that some of these mutations are expressed ( Supplementary Note Section 6 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 39 [href=this file] ).
Some of these rarely mutated genes are inevitably false positive predictions of the analysis, but many (including , , , , , and others) exhibit either mutational clustering or protein interactions that support a role for the observed somatic aberrations ( Supplementary Tables 6–18 [href=this file] ).
Our analysis complements other recent Pan-Cancer analyses including studies that analyze only one type of aberration or restrict attention to recurrent aberrations ( Supplementary Note Section 8.3 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 27 [href=this file] ).
The statistical test is the same as the two-stage statistical test introduced in the original HotNet algorithm ( Supplementary Note Section 1.3 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figures 20–23 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 28 [href=this file] ).
HotNet2 has two parameters β and δ, and selects values for both of these parameters using procedures. β is selected from the protein-protein interaction network, of any gene scores ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.1 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figure 24 [href=#SD1] , and Supplementary Table 29 [href=this file] ). We evaluated the sensitivity of the HotNet2 results to the value of β and found that varying β ±10% has only a minor effect on the results, with at most 7 genes (3.8% of total) added/removed from the subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 28 [href=this file] ). The value of δ is chosen such that large connected components are not found using the observed gene score distribution on random networks with the same degree distribution as the observed network ( Supplementary Note Section 1.4.2 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figure 25 [href=#SD1] , and Supplementary Table 30 [href=this file] ). We evaluated the sensitivity of the HotNet2 results to the value of δ, and found that varying δ ±5% changed at most 35 genes (12.3% of total) in the subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 29 [href=this file] ).
We found that HotNet2 returns >80% fewer hot stars/spiders than HotNet on the Pan-Cancer datasets ( Supplementary Table 31 [href=this file] ). This is a major difference between the algorithms and is one of the reasons why HotNet fails to find statistically significant results ( ≤ 0.01 for any subnetwork size ) on three of six runs ( Supplementary Table 32,33 [href=this file] ), while HotNet2 finds statistically significant results on all six runs.
We also show that HotNet2 has much higher specificity than HotNet, DAVID, and GSEA in identifying genes satisfying the 20/20 rule ( Supplementary Note Section 8.1.4 [href=#SD1] , Supplementary Figure 27 [href=#SD1] , and Supplementary Tables 34–36 [href=this file] ).
Most of the subnetworks (12/14) identified by HotNet2 were also found when we remove the requirement for RNA-Seq expression ( Supplementary Table 37 [href=this file] ). Notable among the additional subnetworks identified when we remove the requirement for RNA-Seq expression is a subnetwork ( Supplementary Table 25 [href=this file] ) containing members of the telomerase complex (including and ) that has a well-studied role in cancer ( Supplementary Figure 30 [href=#SD1] and Supplementary Table 38 [href=this file] ). We found only minor differences in the HotNet2 subnetworks ( Supplementary Table 39 [href=this file] ), demonstrating that our reported subnetworks are altered by somatic aberrations in these samples.",xlsx,Pan-Cancer Network Analysis Identifies Combinations of Rare Somatic Mutations across Pathways and Protein Complexes - PMC,HTML,"(365KB, xlsx)",media p,/articles/instance/4444046/bin/NIHMS644198-supplement-2.xlsx,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

To avoid any substantial bias due to non-tumor cell contamination, a stringent purity threshold was determined by applying Wilcoxon test, for which the degree of contamination of claudin-low tumors was not statistically different from that of non-claudin-low tumors, thus enabling a comparable distribution of tumors (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). Demonstrating an unexpected degree of diversity, only 35.6% of these tumors were classified as TNBCs (Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] ). This result was not due to the purity selection, as the percentage of TNBCs within all claudin-low tumors was similar before applying the purity threshold (Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). 
Only 17.8% were found in cluster 10, whereas 48.8% and 17.8% were found in integrative clusters 4 and 3, respectively, regardless of tumor purity when compared with non-claudin-low tumors (Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). After having previously removed germline copy number variations (CNVs), we analyzed B allele frequency (BAF) and log R ratio (LRR) profiles of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) localized in genomic regions of deletion (LRR segment mean cutoff value < −0.4) (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 3a, c [this file] ). Consistent with these data, the analysis of somatic mutations highlighted the presence of several point mutations with a variant allele frequency higher than 0.4 (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] ). 
Of note, although these analyses were performed on tumors selected for their high tumor purity, similar data were obtained when studying the whole cohort of claudin-low tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ), further strengthening the characterization of the three claudin-low subgroups. 
Of note, global gene expression signatures demonstrated that the CL2 and CL3 subgroups showed lower luminal- and basal-related signature scores, respectively, compared with luminal- and basal-like breast tumors, while exhibiting a significant enrichment in invasiveness-related signatures (Supplementary Fig. 5a, b [this file] ). 
A claudin-low gene list of 137 genes discriminating the 3 claudin-low subgroups was thus created (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ). This expression-based classifier showed an accuracy of 91% when compared with the FGA-based classification using Gaussian finite mixture models (Supplementary Fig. 5c, d [this file] ). Validating the accuracy of our classifier, CL1, CL2, and CL3 tumors and cell lines showed low, moderate, and elevated FGA levels, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 6e, f [this file] ). Of note, we performed a pathway analysis of CL1 discriminant genes that revealed an enrichment in stem cell and pediatric cancer markers (Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] ). 
Differentially methylated gene analysis was next performed in claudin-low subgroups followed by pathway-enrichment analysis, using over 15,000 pathways available in MSigDB (HALLMARKS, C2, and C5 gene sets) (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). The CL1 subgroup had the highest score for stemness- ( , ) and EMT- (mesenchymal markers: , , ; epithelial markers: , ) related genes, whereas CL2 and CL3 displayed an intermediate score compared with CL1 tumors and with their relative luminal/basal counterparts (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
CL1 tumors mainly display hypomethylated genes that are related to a stemness phenotype, CL2 tumors are overall hypermethylated for genes associated with basal-like features, and CL3 tumors show more heterogeneous methylation profiles with both hypermethylated genes (linked to luminal phenotype) and hypomethylated genes (relative to basal-like characteristics) (see Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] for methodology). 
Additional gene expression analyses performed on METABRIC and TCGA cohorts using two different cellular signature deconvolution algorithms confirmed that these tumors were highly infiltrated by immune cells (Supplementary Fig. 9a–d [this file] ). Nevertheless, unsupervised clustering of microenvironment signatures (immune and non-immune cell subsets) did not allow to discriminate the different claudin-low subgroups (Supplementary Fig. 9e–h [this file] ). 
Supporting our previous results, CL2 and CL3 showed, among the three claudin-low subgroups, the highest score for luminal- (estrogen-related response) and basal-related (proliferation and DDR) signatures, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] ). Furthermore, both CL2 and CL3 showed an activation of the EMT process (Fig. 6a, b, g [rid=Fig6] ), coherent with the downregulation of hormone (in CL2) and proliferation/DDR (in CL3) signatures, compared with luminal and basal tumors, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 10 [this file] and Fig. 6g [rid=Fig6] ). Moreover, CL1 displayed a low proliferation activity and a low DDR (Supplementary Fig. 10a, b, e, f [this file] ), as well as a strong TP53 signaling pathway signature associated with a low frequency of mutations (Fig. 6c, d, g [rid=Fig6] ). 
When stratified by CL subgroups, variations in survival outcome were found, consistent with their presumed origin (Supplementary Fig. 11 [this file] ). 
These traits include (i) a high expression of the ZEB1 EMT-inducing transcription factor and of its target, the methionine sulfoxide reductase MSRB3; (ii) a frequent activation of the RAS-MAPK signaling pathway; (iii) a low activation of the DDR; and (iv) a low frequency of mutations (Supplementary Figs. 8 [this file] and 10 [this file] , and Fig. 6 [rid=Fig6] ). 
The use of a high-purity threshold for tumor selection allowed to circumvent the contamination bias related to the tumor-related centroid (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] ). 
Finally, the nearest shrunken centroid classifier encompassed 137 genes whose expression discriminate the three FGA-related claudin-low subgroups in METABRIC cohort (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
As previously described for genome-wide expression–methylation quantitative trait loci analysis , genes for which methylation -values were negatively correlated with expression values (Spearman’s < 0 and FDR -value < 0.05) were selected for differential methylation analysis (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ).",pdf,Comprehensive characterization of claudin-low breast tumors reflects the impact of the cell-of-origin on cancer evolution,XML,,,,,,,

This analysis revealed widespread differences in APA, identifying 628 differential APA (dAPA) events ( Fig. 3c [rid=F3] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ) that resulted from an increased usage of either the distal or the proximal PAS to similar degree (14.29% of all genes with more than 1 polyadenylation site). 
Consistent with the observations in iNs, this analysis confirmed widespread dAPA in postmortem PFC from ISCZ ( Fig. 3e [rid=F3] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ) as well as substantial overlap with dAPA in iNs ( Fig. 3f [rid=F3] ). 
Strikingly, genes subject to dAPA in ISCZ were strongly enriched for synapse related processes such as glutamatergic neurotransmission, synaptic membrane components, synaptic plasticity or vesicle biology in both iNs and human PFC ( Fig. 4a [rid=F4] , b [rid=F4] , and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
RBP motif analysis in the UTRs of transcripts subject to dAPA identified numerous expressed RBPs with critical roles for neuronal biology such as QKI, ELAVL and RBM proteins ( Fig. 5c [rid=F5] and Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ). 
Similarly, we also corrected the R values for gender, batch and TechnicalPC1 using beta regression and used the residuals to compute the average difference in R values between the groups (ΔAPA, Supplementary Table 3 [this file] ).

Principal component analysis (PCA) indicated that after using the ‘ComBat’ function to remove batch effects, there was no significant batch effect in the merged cohorts of eight microarray datasets ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B [rid=fig1s1] ) and two RNA sequencing datasets ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, D [rid=fig1s1] , Supplementary file 1c [this file] ). 
The stromal and tumor components significantly were correlated with decreased survival, particularly in the case of mesenchymal cells, endothelial cells, metastasis, differentiation, and EMT signatures ( Figure 1—figure supplement 1L [rid=fig1s1] , Supplementary file 1d [this file] ). 
Differences in the TME components between the CCCRC subtypes were also observed in the analysis of previously reported immune and stromal signatures obtained by the microenvironment cell populations (MCP)-counter, CIBERSORT, and ESTIMATE algorithm, and 10 classical oncogenic pathway activities and 86 metabolic pathway enrichment scores calculated by GSVA ( Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–E [rid=fig1s3] , Supplementary file 1e [this file] ). 
We analyzed the 86 metabolic pathways obtained from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database ( Supplementary file 1e [this file] ) and observed that the number of upregulated metabolic pathways of the C3 subtype was the lowest. 
We further analyzed the association of CCCRC subtypes with clinicopathological characteristics ( Supplementary file 1f [this file] , Supplementary file 1g [this file] ). Multivariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis showed that the C4 subtype was an independent predictor of the best OS and DFS, whereas the C3 subtype was an independent predictor of the worst OS and DFS after adjustment for age, gender, tumor site, TNM stage, grade, adjuvant chemotherapy or not, MSI status, BRAF and KRAS mutations, and the CMS classification system in the combined cohort (the CRC-AFFY and CRC-RNAseq cohorts) ( Supplementary file 1h [this file] ). 
The 254 CRC samples in the TCGA-CRC dataset were categorized as these three phenotypes based on the abundance of lymphocytes and their spatial location with malignant epithelial cells ( Supplementary file 1i [this file] ). 
A total of 2196 samples were obtained from ten publicly available datasets ( Supplementary file 1c [this file] ). Detailed information on the sample size and the corresponding clinicopathological data of the CRC-AFFY and CRC-RNAseq cohorts are summarized in Supplementary file 1c [this file] and Supplementary file 1f [this file] . 
The 4525 genes from each of the 61 TME-related signatures are listed in Supplementary file 1a [this file] , as well as the source of each signature.

In terms of the differences in SCNA, the C1 subtype with the highest CIN level harbored significantly more amplified chromosomal regions (20q12, 20q13.12, 20q11.21, and 20q13.32) and deleted chromosomal regions (18q21.2, 18q22.1, and 18q12.3) (all p-value <0.05) ( Figure 3A, B [rid=fig3] , Supplementary file 2b [this file] ). The C4 subtype had the highest frequency of mutations in the cell cycle, HIPPO, MYC, NOTCH, PI3K, TGFB, and RTK–RAS pathways (all p-value <0.05) ( Figure 3C [rid=fig3] , Supplementary file 2c [this file] ). 
The lists of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between CCCRC subtypes were compiled in Supplementary file 2d [this file] . In addition, we also analyzed the correlations between all genes and the exclusion and dysfunction scores obtained from the Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion (TIDE) website, as well as the MSI expression signature, which provided a useful reference for subsequent research in the discovery of new therapeutic targets ( Supplementary file 2e [this file] ). 
Furthermore, we intersected all the positives for increasing gene expression from C1 to C4, C2, and C3 subtypes in the CRC-AFFY and CRC-RNAseq cohorts and obtained 20 CCCRC genes ( Figure 4E [rid=fig4] , Supplementary file 2f [this file] ), which were associated with TGF-beta signaling and infiltrating nerves. 
We obtained the GEP for 7766T cells from 12 patients with CRC, including four patients with the C1 subtype, one patient with the C2 subtype, two patients with the C3 subtype, and four patients with the C4 subtype ( Supplementary file 2g [this file] ). The markers of the T cell clusters were summarized in Supplementary file 2h [this file] . 
For instance, KDM1A and RAD21 are specific genes for C1 subtype, and it has been reported that interfering with them could activate interferon signaling and induce tumor intrinsic immunogenicity ( Deng et al., 2022 [rid=bib26] ; Nguyen et al., 2022 [rid=bib65] ; Supplementary file 2d [this file] ). In this study, the expression levels of SPP1 and SERPINB9 were found to be significantly positively correlated with the exclusion and dysfunction scores (TIDE score), respectively ( Supplementary file 2e [this file] ). 
A total of 12 CRC samples with bulk RNAseq and scRNAseq data were obtained from the GSE108989 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE108989) dataset ( Zhang et al., 2018 [rid=bib96] ; Supplementary file 2g [this file] ).",xlsx,Comprehensive characterization of tumor microenvironment in colorectal cancer via molecular analysis,XML,,,,,,,

The 71 human CRC cell lines were classified into four CCCRC subtypes ( Supplementary file 3b [this file] ). 
We established the CCCRC classifier on the training set by utilizing multiple machine learning algorithms based on the GEP of 80 upregulated subtype-specific genes (Materials and methods, Supplementary file 3c [this file] ). Notably, the CCCRC classifier based on the xgboost algorithm displayed robust performance across gene expression platforms, Affymetrix and RNA-sequencing platforms, exhibiting a balanced accuracy of >80% for all subtypes ( Supplementary file 3d [this file] ). 
The 1660 genes assigned to 86 human metabolism-related pathways are listed in Supplementary file 3e [this file] . Ten oncogenic signatures containing 331 genes and the terminally exhausted T cell signature were retrieved from a previously published study ( Beltra et al., 2020 [rid=bib11] ; Sanchez-Vega et al., 2018 [rid=bib73] ; Supplementary file 3e [this file] ). 
The R package ‘RTN’ was used to reconstruct the transcriptional regulatory networks of regulons ( Robertson et al., 2017 [rid=bib69] ), including 31 transcription factors and 82 chromatin remodeling genes, that were associated with CRC ( Vymetalkova et al., 2019 [rid=bib85] ; Xu et al., 2021 [rid=bib91] ; Supplementary file 3f [this file] ).

The intersection of up- and down-regulated DEGs from four data sets (|log2FC|>1, padj<0.05) showed that greater than 70% of DEGs were unique to one experiment, whereas only ~3% genes were regulated in all four data sets ( Fig. 3C [rid=F3] and 3D [rid=F3] , Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ). We classified the DEGs into four classes based upon the number of data sets they shared and compared the fold change regulation ( Supplementary Table S3 [this file] ). 
Importantly, the same ER antibody (Santa Cruz sc543) was utilized in all experiments to pull down ER ( Supplementary Table S4 [this file] ). We also examined the quality parameters (e.g., percentage of reads within peaks and percentage of reads within Blacklist regions) of derived peaks to examine technical variation ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). The number of peaks in the vehicle groups showed a large variation ranging from 332 (C42) to 23,189 (C42) ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). As expected, E2 stimulation resulted in a 1.6-to-27.5-fold gain of ER binding ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ).

Three of the patients had heterozygous mutations in , the gene most frequently mutated in CdLS (ref. , Fig. 1a [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1a, b [this file] ). 
To characterise gene expression in CdLS patient neurons we isolated nuclei from the prefrontal cortex, stained with the neuronal marker NeuN (ref. ), and sorted NeuN positive and NeuN negative nuclei by flow cytometry (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). However, CAGE analysis of promoters showed separation of CdLS patient and control samples along the major principle component PC1, and revealed significant deregulation of 766 gene promoters in CdLS neurons (adj < 0.05; 358 upregulated, 408 downregulated; Supplementary Fig. 2a–c [this file] , Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). Gene promoters that were downregulated in CdLS neurons were enriched for the gene ontology (GO) terms synaptic signalling and organization, ion and neurotransmitter transport, axon development, behavior and cognition, while upregulated promoters showed no striking functional enrichment (Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] , Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). RNA-seq identified 617 differentially expressed genes (adj < 0.05) in CdLS neurons, 310 genes were up- and 307 were downregulated (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). In close agreement with CAGE, genes that were downregulated by RNA-seq were related to synaptic transmission, signalling processes, learning and behaviour, and sphingolipid metabolism, while upregulated genes showed no striking functional enrichment (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Data 4 [this file] ). 
The direction of gene deregulation by RNA-seq and CAGE was highly correlated ( = 0.68, = < 2.2e-16 for genes found deregulated by RNA-seq or CAGE, and = 0.95, = < 2.2e-16 for genes found deregulated by both RNA-seq and CAGE; Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] ). 
RNA-seq of NeuN-negative nuclei showed upregulation of immune response genes that were not seen in NeuN-positive nuclei, including interferon response, JAK-STAT signalling, and the complement pathway (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , Supplementary Data 5 [this file] , 6 [this file] ). There was significant overlap between changes in gene expression in human CdLS with published gene expression in heterozygous mouse brain at embryonic day 13.5 (e13.5; whole brain versus human CdLS NeuN positive and NeuN negative nuclei combined; = 1.32e-14, Odds ratio = 2.05) and with gene expression in cortical neurons in explant culture ( cortical neurons versus human CdLS NeuN positive neurons; Supplementary Data 7 [this file] ; = 8.38e-06, Odds ratio = 3.03). 
We established explant cultures from cortices at e14.5 under conditions that enrich for post-mitotic neurons and promote neuronal maturation (Fig. 2a [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 5a, b [this file] ). 
Constructs were tagged by V5 and t2a-fused GFP (ERt2-TEV) for identification of ERt2-TEV-expressing cells (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). ERt2-TEV remained cytoplasmic until nuclear translocation of ERt2-TEV was triggered, which occurred within minutes of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4-OHT) addition (Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). Addition of doxycycline leads to the expression of TEV protease with an exogeneous nuclear localization sequence (NLS-TEV, Supplementary Fig. 6a, b [this file] ). Induction of NLS-TEV depleted ~70% of RAD21-TEV within 24 h of doxycycline addition (Supplementary Fig. 6c [this file] ). 
RNA-seq 24 h after 4-OHT-induced nuclear translocation of ERt2-TEV identified 750 deregulated (adj < 0.05) genes, of which 463 were down- and 287 were upregulated (Fig. 2d [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Data 8 [this file] ). As observed in CdLS neurons, no striking enrichment was observed for upregulated genes (Fig. 2e [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Data 9 [this file] ). 
As observed for the nuclear translocation of ERt2-TEV, downregulated genes were enriched for adhesion, signalling, synaptic function and development (Supplementary Fig. 5d, e [this file] , Supplementary Data 10 [this file] , 11 [this file] ). There was extensive overlap between genes deregulated by acute cohesin depletion with genes deregulated in neurons (this study) and embryonic brain , but less so with genes deregulated in other mouse models of neuronal dysfunction (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
Reduced mRNA expression translated into reduced levels of protein in RAD21-TEV neurons, as illustrated for NLGN1, encoded by (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] , Supplementary Data 12 [this file] ). 
These shared ASD genes mediate important neuronal functions in cell adhesion ( ) signalling ( ), ion channels ( ), synaptic transmission ( ), transcription ( ) and sphingolipid metabolism ( ) (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Gene expression changes in Rett syndrome, but not other human neurological diseases , showed significant overlap with neurons (Odds ratio = 2.06, = 4.64e-10; Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
Remarkably, comparison of RNA-seq during RAD21-TEV depletion (24 h) and after RAD21-TEV rescue (day 7) showed that the vast majority of genes that were found deregulated after 24 h (695 of 720 or 96.5%) were fully rescued upon restoration of cohesin levels (Fig. 4c, e [rid=Fig4] ; Supplementary Data 13 [this file] ). These experiments confirmed that rescue of gene expression required the restoration of RAD21 expression and was not due to the adaptation of neurons to reduced cohesin expression (Supplementary Fig 10 [this file] ; Supplementary Data 14 [this file] ). 
These included 14 genes implicated in ASD and shared between CdLS and NLS-TEV (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ). 
Sequence data was analysed using the 4 Cseqpipe software suite with the setting of “-stat_type mean -trend_resolution 40,000”. 4C-seq primers are listed in Supplementary Data 15 [this file] .",pdf,Neuronal genes deregulated in Cornelia de Lange Syndrome respond to removal and re-expression of cohesin,XML,,,,,,,

S1.1f [this file] ) and 9,938 “negative” element-gene pairs where no significant reduction in expression was observed despite the experiment having good power to detect >15–25% effects on gene expression ( Note S1 [this file] ). 
S10 [this file] ). 
S8c [this file] ), and the correlation between the predictive scores and the measured quantitative effect on expression ( Extended Data Fig. 2f [this file] , Fig. S9 [this file] ), using hold-one-chromosome-out cross-validation for supervised models. S8c [this file] , Extended Data Fig. 2f [this file] ), including at different distance thresholds ( Fig. 2c [rid=F2] ). S8c [this file] , Extended Data Fig. 2f [this file] ). We describe detailed evaluations of these other predictors and baseline methods in Note S2 [this file] , Note S3 [this file] , Note S5 [this file] , and Note S7 [this file] . 
ENCODE-rE2G and ENCODE-rE2G perform comparably to other wellperforming models (both with enrichment = 28 at a recall of 15%) ( Fig. 2d [rid=F2] , Table S15 [this file7] ). We also examined fine-mapped eQTL variant-gene links from 11 other GTEx tissues that were represented in ENCODE biosamples ( Table S14 [this file6] ). Using the score threshold corresponding to 70% in the K562 CRISPR dataset, ENCODE-rE2G achieved an average enrichment of 6.5 across tissues (range: 3.5–11.4), similar than other predictive and baseline models, while achieving a stronger recall, identifying an average of 16% (range: 10–22%) of fine-mapped eQTL variants and linking them to the correct eGene ( Extended Data Fig. 3c [this file] , d [this file] ). 
These conclusions were supported by additional benchmarking analyses ( Extended Data Fig. 4 [this file] ). 
S2.1a [this file] ). 
Many ENCODE-rE2G enhancers show elevated levels of active chromatin marks, such as H3K27ac and DNase-seq (mean DNase-seq signal for candidate elements across biosamples = 3.27; mean for enhancers linked to at least one gene = 7.52) — but importantly, many do not (15.6% of enhancers have DNase-seq scores below the global median) ( Extended Data Fig 5h [this file] ). S2.1d [this file] ). In part for this reason, annotations of enhancers based on 1D chromatin state alone miss 33% (chromHMM) or 61% (cCRE Catalog) of ENCODE-rE2G enhancers, as well as 30% or 12%, respectively, of the validated enhancergene pairs from the Nasser ., 2021 unbiased CRISPR DHS tiling dataset ( Extended Data Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
As expected, many element-gene regulatory interactions were highly cell-type specific: 26.4% were present in only one biosample (mean = 34.49, median = 7 biosamples) ( Fig. 3e [rid=F3] ), and predicted regulatory interactions were much more specific than the activity of either the promoters or enhancers alone ( Extended Data Fig 5g [this file] , h [this file] ). 
As previously observed, fine-mapped variants underlying enhancers were often predicted to regulate multiple genes (average=3.4, max=56), including 62% that are linked to different genes in different cell types; this appears to be a fundamental property of enhancer-promoter regulation , and motivates combining locus-specific variant-to-gene information with orthogonal information about gene function ( Note S7 [this file] , Fig S7.1 [this file] ). 
This combination of ENCODE-rE2G and PoPS predicted a target gene for 3,528 out of 13,012 non-coding credible sets with a PIP > 0.1 fine-mapped variant spanning all traits; this included 5,851 out of 29.2K fine-mapped GWAS variants ( Table S13 [this file5] ), representing a 3.7-fold excess overlap compared to control variants (all distal noncoding variants detected in the 1000 Genomes project, =9.2 million) ( Fig. 4b [rid=F4] ). Other interesting examples at the and loci are reported in Note S7 [this file] ( Fig S7.2 [this file] ). 
We provide further analysis and guidelines regarding the value of adding new cell types to the ENCODE resource, assessing tissue-specificity of the ENCODE-rE2G biosample predictions, evaluating other combinations of ENCODE-rE2G and PoPS, and restricting our ENCODE-rE2G analyses to top disease-enriched biosamples for identifying possible cell types and target genes for GWAS loci in Note S7 [this file] ( Fig S7.1 [this file] . 
S4.1 [this file] - 2 [this file] , Note S4 [this file] , Note S5 [this file] ). 
These results are consistent with the importance of enhancer activity and 3D contact in enhancer regulation and highlight the utility of combining them as in the ABC model ( Fig. 2b [rid=F2] , c [rid=F2] , Fig S4.3 [this file] ). 
S11 [this file] ). S11a [this file] ). 
Out of 6 methods for estimating 3D enhancer-promoter contact frequency in the ABC model, we found that the best dataset was cell-type-specific ENCODE Hi-C (precision at 70% recall = 53.8%; Hi-C depth = 2 billion reads, 5-kb resolution), which outperformed other datasets including Hi-C (1 billion reads) or an inverse function of distance (precision at 70% recall = 50.4% or 31.8%, respectively) ( Fig. 5g [rid=F5] , Note S2 [this file] ). S2.1f [this file] , g [this file] ). 
Key additional features were related to promoter class and enhancerenhancer interactions ( Fig. 5b [rid=F5] , h [rid=F5] , Fig S4.4 [this file] ). 
S6.1b [this file] ) to have a fine-mapped eQTL variant in a distal accessible site ( Fig. S6.1a [this file] ). S6.1c [this file] - f [this file] ). Together, these observations support a model in which sequence-intrinsic features of the promoters of ubiquitously expressed genes make them less sensitive to distal enhancers (see Note S6 [this file] ). 
In each dataset, perturbations to individual enhancers on average reduced H3K27ac signal at other nearby enhancers, and the magnitude of the effect decreased as enhancer-enhancer distance increased ( Fig. 6g [rid=F6] , h [rid=F6] , Extended Data Fig. 8 [this file] ). 
S6.1b [this file] ), possibly because they contain built-in motifs for activating transcription factors that buffer them against distal enhancers . 
The CRISPR datasets still have a relatively small number of positive examples; were designed with certain biases in enhancer and gene selection; do not distinguish from effects; are conducted largely in a single cell type (K562); and are underpowered to detect regulatory interactions with small effect sizes ( ., <25%) (see Note S1 [this file] ).",pdf,An encyclopedia of enhancer-gene regulatory interactions in the human genome,XML,,,,,,,

These analyses showed no significant changes in expression across tumor stages (Supplementary Fig. 1b [this file] ). Patients of stages I-III and stage IV were stratified in three groups based on the level of expression (MLL1 low, medium, and high, Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] ). High levels were associated with shorter survival and increased risk of disease relapse (Supplementary Fig. 1c, d [this file] ). Immuno-staining for β-catenin revealed high levels of nuclear β-catenin, indicative of high Wnt signaling, in a major portion of the analyzed tumors (Supplementary Fig. 1e [this file] ). Across all tumor stages, carcinomas with high levels of nuclear β-catenin showed strong expression of MLL1 (Fig. 1b [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1f, g [this file] ). 
Mll1 is gradually lost towards the differentiated compartment (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] and Supplementary Fig. 1h [this file] ). A crypt–villus gradient was also observed for H3K4 tri-methylation (H3K4me3) (Supplementary Fig. 1i [this file] ). We observed a similar distribution of Mll1, Ki67, and H3K4me3 in the mouse colon (Supplementary Fig. 1j–l [this file] ). 
The dysplastic tissue in the β-cat ; Mll1 intestines showed an expansion of Lgr5-GFP stem cells (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] , upper picture, Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ) and an increase in the stem cell genes , , and (Supplementary Fig. 2b [this file] ). The stem cell expansion in β-cat tumorous intestines was associated with an increase in Mll1 protein levels (Supplementary Fig. 2c [this file] , the mutant β-catenin allele is marked by an arrow, quantification is shown below). Specifically, tumor cells with high levels of β-catenin expressed high nuclear levels of Mll1 (Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] ; green arrows mark β-catenin cells, white arrowheads indicate β-catenin cells). Equal recombination was observed at day 5 in 25% of crypts (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] , upper row, quantification in f). Subsequently, the mutant cells in β-cat ; Mll1 mice expanded at day 10 and formed LacZ dysplasia at day 30 (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] , middle and lower left pictures, quantification in f). In contrast, β-cat ; Mll1 mice showed a gradual reduction of LacZ cells down to 10% over time (Supplementary Fig. 2e [this file] , lower right picture, quantification in f). At 30 days, the β-cat ; Mll1 mice exhibited crypts with LacZ long-lived Paneth cells interspersed with non-mutant (LacZ ) stem cells (Supplementary Fig. 2g [this file] , marked by an arrow). Furthermore, we observed crypts that were normally shaped and depleted of Mll1 but with nuclear β-catenin (β-cat ) and positive for Lgr5-GFP; they exhibited a slight reduction in proliferation, as seen by a decrease in the incorporation of BrdU (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] , lower picture, Supplementary Fig. 2h, i [this file] ). Apoptosis was not detected in β-cat ; Mll1 crypts (Supplementary Fig. 2j [this file] ). 
All β-cat organoids grew independently of R-spondin1 (Supplementary Fig. 2k [this file] ). β-cat induced a strong expansion of Lgr5-GFP stem cells (Fig. 2d, e [rid=Fig2] , second panel). Single β-cat ; Mll1 cells re-formed spheroid-shaped organoids over many passages with high efficiency (Supplementary Fig. 2l [this file] ), demonstrating the proliferative potential and self-renewal capacity of Mll1-deficient β-cat cells. From the seventh passage on, β-cat ; Mll1 cells formed less organoids, which were smaller and acquired a thick-walled shape (Supplementary Fig. 2m [this file] ), indicating differentiation and progressive exhaustion of stemness upon loss of Mll1. 
Under non-oncogenic conditions without genetic stabilization of β-catenin, mutant Mll1 stem cells produced progeny up to 20 days after the induction of mutagenesis, as seen by LacZ lineage tracing in Mll1 mice (Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] , quantification on the right). From 20 days onwards, Mll1 crypts were progressively lost, but a substantial number of Mll1 crypts persisted beyond 50 days after induction (Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] , quantification on the right). 
Genes specific for enteroendocrine and tuft cells did not undergo major changes (Supplementary Fig. 3c [this file] ). β-cat ; Mll1 stem cells exhibited a strongly increased expression of , a transcription factor essential for secretory lineage determination , and its target gene , which instructs secretory cell differentiation in Paneth and goblet cells (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] ). 
To investigate the essential role of Mll1 in the stemness of human colon tumors, we established stable, doxycycline-inducible shMLL1 single-cell clones of the human colon adenocarcinoma cell lines Ls174T and DLD1, which exhibited a strong reduction of MLL1 (Supplementary Fig. 4a–d [this file] ). The ablation of MLL1 did not affect the expression of other MLL family members (Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ). A significant growth reduction was detected only after four passages and a total of 10–14 days of culture (Supplementary Fig. 4f, g [this file] ). We found that MLL1 protein was strongly increased in 3D (non-adherent, self-renewing) sphere cultures of human Ls174T cells compared to adherent cultures, while the expression of the family member SETD1A was not changed (Supplementary Fig. 4h [this file] , quantification on the right). In contrast to the 2D culture, the ablation of MLL1 in 3D sphere cultures had a rapid effect on the growth and self-renewal of the tumor cells: secondary sphere formation of shMLL1 cells was reduced by 80% in Ls174T and by 60% in DLD1 cells, compared to control cells (Fig. 4a [rid=Fig4] and Supplementary Fig. 4i [this file] , quantifications on the right). Residual shMLL1 spheres exhibited minimal MLL1 expression and reduced proliferation, as shown by staining for Ki67 (Supplementary Fig. 4j [this file] ). shMLL1 spheres were negative for the apoptosis marker cleaved Caspase-3 (Supplementary Fig. 4k [this file] , western blot on the right). 
The residual xenografts showed a strong reduction of MLL1 (Supplementary Fig. 4l [this file] , quantification below) and H3K4me3 (Supplementary Fig. 4m [this file] , upper panel), and significantly fewer proliferating cells (Supplementary Fig. 4m [this file] , middle panel, quantifications on the right). The apoptosis marker cleaved Caspase-3 did not increase in shMLL1 Ls174T tumors (Supplementary Fig. 4m [this file] , lower panel, western blot on the right). The shMLL1 human Ls174T xenografts and sphere cells showed enhanced differentiation with an increase in the expression of the Paneth cell-specific genes and and the goblet cell markers and (Supplementary Fig. 4n [this file] ), as was also observed in the β-cat mouse tumor model. An increase in expression was also observed in DLD1 sphere cells (Supplementary Fig. 4o [this file] ). The expression of the differentiation-associated cell cycle inhibitor was upregulated in shMLL1 Ls174T xenografts and spheres (Supplementary Fig. 4p, q [this file] , quantifications on the right). 
Comparison of the differentially expressed genes with a signature of Mll1-ablated fibroblasts revealed deregulation of MLL1 target genes such as and (Supplementary Fig. 4r [this file] , Supplementary Data 2 [rid=MOESM5] ). A volcano plot of the deregulated genes overlaid with this signature showed a predominant downregulation of stem cell genes upon knockdown of MLL1; these included , , , and the Wnt-regulated gene (Supplementary Data 3 [rid=MOESM6] and Fig. 4d [this file] ). The selective regulation of Wnt-dependent stem cell genes was also observed in DLD1 human colon cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. 4s [this file] ). 
Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed high H3K4me3 and low H3K27me3 levels at the transcription start sites (TSS) of the MLL1-regulated stem cell genes , , and (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). Ablation of MLL1 shifted the epigenetic state of the stem cell genes from transcriptionally permissive (H3K4me3) to repressed (H3K27me3) (Fig. 5a [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). Global levels of H3K4 and H3K27 methylation were not changed (Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] ). We identified MLL1 binding to the promoters of the intestinal stem cell genes , , and (Fig. 5b [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 5c, d [this file] ). Strongly reduced binding of MLL1 was observed in shMLL1 Ls174T and DLD1 cells (Fig. 5b [rid=Fig5] and Supplementary Fig. 5c–e [this file] ).

We compared them with six independent microglia-specific gene expression datasets from transgenic mouse models and humans with AD pathology to identify overlapping patterns of gene expression ( Figures 1B [rid=F1] , S1C [this file] – S1E [this file] , and S2F [this file] ; Table S2 [rid=SD3] ), supporting their generalizability. 
We confirmed that the MNMs include expected traits indicative of neuroimmune activity, including: (1) known neuroregulatory pathways, such as complement activation ( Schafer et al., 2013 [rid=R74] ), Toll-like receptor (TLR), and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) ( Heneka et al., 2013 [rid=R32] ; Figure 1E [rid=F1] ); (2) strong association with tau pathology, a neuronal driver of neurodegeneration ( Figures 1F [rid=F1] and S2A [this file] ); and (3) high overlap with the conserved neuroinflammatory module we identified in our prior study (NAI; Swarup et al., 2019 [rid=R85] ; Figures S2B [this file] and S2C [this file] ). 
In addition, all MNMs are preserved in three different transgenic mouse models expressing human mutations ( Swarup et al., 2019 [rid=R85] ; Figure S2D [this file] ) and in microglial-specific datasets from mouse models expressing ( Srinivasan et al., 2016 [rid=R80] ) and ( Wang et al., 2015 [rid=R90] ) mutations, with the exception of M_UP3, which is only weakly preserved in one of the two datasets from mice expressing early AD mutations ( Figure S2E [this file] ). A few modules display variability in their differential expression in different transgenic models, suggesting that they may be conditional on mutational interactions with disease-stage and disease-specific pathology, or possibly by other technical factors distinguishing these mouse models ( Figure S2F [this file] ). 
Finally, we observed an increased expression of genes involved in viral response and type II IFN response represented by M_UP3 ( Figures 1E [rid=F1] , 2A [rid=F2] , 2B [rid=F2] , and S2G [this file] ). 
We identified the earliest interconnected MNM genes present in pre-symptomatic disease tissue and called them early MNM sub-modules, reasoning that casual disease pathways should enrich among the earliest MNM components in disease ( Figure S3 [this file] ; STAR Methods [rid=S10] ). We confirmed significant associations using exome array data ( Chen et al., 2015 [rid=R9] ), replicating significant associations between AD and M_UP3 (β= 0.19, p < 0.001), FTD and early_UP1 (β= 0.25, p < 0.001), and FTD and early_DOWN1 (β= 0.15 p < 0.001) ( Figure S3G [this file] ). 
Consistent with these causal relationships defined by genetic enrichment, we were able to demonstrate that the expression of genes involved with viral defense, including the type I IFN response and dsRNA binding, were highly associated with the level of pathological tau phosphorylation in the brains of TPR50 mice ( Figures S3H [this file] – S3J [this file] ). 
We found that gene overexpression has inverse effects on modules A and B ( Figure 4D [rid=F4] ; 2,161 genes; STAR Methods [rid=S10] ), which we also confirmed at the levels of gene connectivity ( Figure S4A [this file] ) and PPI ( Figure S4B [this file] ). These patterns were confirmed in 12 independent transcriptome datasets ( Figures S4D [this file] – S4I [this file] ), indicating that these two modules represent robust, early microglia responses mediating opposing signaling pathways. 
Module A includes protein complexes and pathways of microglial innate neuroimmune activation, including the NLRP3 inflammasome ( , , , , and ) ( Ahmed et al., 2017 [rid=R2] ; Ising et al., 2019 [rid=R38] ; Lučiūnaitė et al., 2019 [rid=R54] ), TLRs ( , , , and ), and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) targets ( Figures 4E [rid=F4] , 4G [rid=F4] , and S4A [this file] ). Supporting this interpretation, we found that purified pathological Aβ, an extracellular inducer of pro-inflammatory microglial activity ( Lučiūnaitė et al., 2019 [rid=R54] ), stimulates NAct in microglia ( Figures 4F [rid=F4] and S4C [this file] ). In contrast, module B includes viral and stress response genes, drivers of immune suppression ( [PD-L1], , , , and ), and the senescence marker, ( Figures 4H [rid=F4] and S4A [this file] ). 
Several features of NSupp suggest that in the context of tauopathy it may also represent an immunosuppressive type of IFN-β signaling in disease-associated microglia that are expressing inhibitory immune checkpoint genes (e.g., [PDL-1], , and ) ( Snell et al., 2017 [rid=R78] ; Wykes and Lewin, 2018 [rid=R94] ) and inhibitors of immune hyperactivity (e.g., ; Basters et al., 2018 [rid=R4] ; Taylor et al., 2018 [rid=R87] ; Figures 4G [rid=F4] , 4H [rid=F4] , and S4A [this file] ). 
NAct is activated by extracellular stimuli working through TLR and related receptors ( Figures 4E [rid=F4] , 4F [rid=F4] , S4A [this file] , and S4C [this file] ). 
Then, as tau pathology leads to chromatin and nucleotide dysregulation before neuronal loss, nucleotide damage signals activate dsRNA receptors to trigger a microglial type I IFN response that drives the expression of NSupp pathways involved in stress response, exosome, and viral entry ( Figure 4H [rid=F4] ), while suppressing the specific microglial immune attack pathways represented by NAct, including the NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR1 and −2 signaling ( Figures 4E [rid=F4] and S4A [this file] ). As disease progresses to include frank neurodegeneration, microglia undergo additional dynamic states, including increased type II IFN signaling, exogenous antigen presentation, T cell regulation, and cell death ( Figures 1E [rid=F1] , 2A [rid=F2] , 2B [rid=F2] , and S2G [this file] ). 
We pre-treated human-induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived microglia ( Haenseler et al., 2017 [rid=R29] ; STAR Methods [rid=S10] ) with IFN-β and tested the ability of fibrillar Aβ, a NAct activator ( Figures 4F [rid=F4] and S4C [this file] ), to induce the secretion of IL-1β, a prominent member of the NAct pathway in these human cells ( Figures 4E [rid=F4] and 4G [rid=F4] ). 
Another prediction based on the mouse microglia module trajectory analysis ( Figure 2 [rid=F2] ) is a delayed, biphasic type II IFN response with early suppression and late increase (M_DOWN1, M_UP3; Figures 1C [rid=F1] , 1E [rid=F1] , 2A [rid=F2] , 2B [rid=F2] , and S2G [this file] ). Remarkably, we observed concordance between disease-associated signaling pathways represented in M_UP3 and microglia from patients with FTD-Pick’s; in particular in type II IFN, a specific activator of M_UP3 ( Figures 2A [rid=F2] , 2B [rid=F2] , 6C [rid=F6] , and S2G [this file] ). Significantly upregulated in bvFTD microglia are genes that can stimulate IFN-γ production ( , , , and ) ( Renkl et al., 2005 [rid=R66] ) and genes that mediate IFN-γ response ( , , , and ; Figures 6C [rid=F6] , 6D [rid=F6] , and S5E [this file] ). 
We find that both dsRNA detection and IFN pathways are highly correlated with pathological tau burden in brain ( Figures S3H [this file] – S3J [this file] ) and both the cytosolic dsRNA receptor (MDA5) and RIG1 pathway are hubs of the NSupp module ( Figure 4H [rid=F4] ). 
The significance of intramodular connectivity was assessed for each module using a permutation test (10,000 permutations), and all modules were confirmed to have permuted p value < 0.001. “Early submodules,” described in Figures 3 [rid=F3] and S3 [this file] , were derived by re-clustering M_UP1 and M_UP2 genes to generate “earlyUP” modules, or M_DOWN1, M_DOWN2 and M_DOWN3 genes to generate “earlyDOWN” modules, using the 3 month of age frontal cortex TPR50 gene expression data ( Swarup et al., 2019 [rid=R85] ). “NSupp and NAct,” described in Figures 4 [rid=F4] and 5 [rid=F5] , were derived from re-clustering the M_UP1 and M_UP2 genes, keeping only genes with annotated PPI in either Bio-grid ( Stark et al., 2006 [rid=R82] ) or Inweb databases ( Rossin et al., 2011 [rid=R69] ), using the same gene expression data used for the consensus WGCNA analysis (purified microglia from the Tg4510 model and frontal cortex TPR50 dataset (6 months of age)). 
Each cluster was then annotated as a major cell type using mean expression of groups of cell type marker genes, including the microglial markers CD74, CSF1R, C3 ( Mathys et al., 2019 [rid=R58] ), PTPRC, and DOCK8 ( Kelley et al., 2018 [rid=R42] ) ( Figure S5A [this file] ). 
In addition, to check that our findings were representative of group effects rather than driven by a few individuals, we compared all disease and control samples for average gene expression and total number of microglia contributed to the analysis ( Figure S5E [this file] ). 
For all boxplots, the center line is at the median and the upper and lower lines are at the 75 and 25 percentiles, respectively ( Figures 4I [rid=F4] , 5C [rid=F5] , 5F [rid=F5] , 5K [rid=F5] , S3B [this file] , S3C [this file] , S4G [this file] – S4I [this file] , and S5C [this file] ). Results of tissue culture experiments show each sample data point as a separate dot, the center line at the group mean, and error bars showing s.e.m. ( Figures 5D [rid=F5] , 5G [rid=F5] , and 5I [rid=F5] ) The barplot in Figure S2G [this file] has the center line at the group mean and error bars as s.e.m. In Figure S5D [this file] , the center line of the boxplot is the sample mean, the upper and lower lines are the 75 and 25 percentiles, respectively, and each dot is the average gene expression among the microglia from one subject, with the size of the dot proportional to the number of microglia contributing to the final analysis from that subject.

To further explore the early microglial response in disease, we re-clustered only the genes from M_UP1 and M_UP2 to identify additional co-expression relationships among them ( Figure 4A [rid=F4] , Module A and Module B; Table S1 [this file] ). 
We next used the CMAP database to find candidate drivers of NSupp and NAct ( STAR Methods [rid=S10] ), identifying genes that regulate the viral activation of type I IFN among the top drivers of NSupp and suppressors of NAct ( ; Marazzi et al., 2012 [rid=R56] ; Table S1 [this file] ).

To explore their preservation across neurodegenerative dementias, we tested module preservation in multiple mouse and human disease datasets (total n = 525 samples from 17 datasets; STAR Methods [rid=S10] ; Table S2 [this file] ), finding significant preservation in transcriptome data from post-mortem human brain tissue from AD ( Allen et al., 2016 [rid=R3] ), FTD ( Chen-Plotkin et al., 2008 [rid=R10] ; Swarup et al., 2019 [rid=R85] ), and PSP ( Allen et al., 2016 [rid=R3] ) patients ( Figure 1G [rid=F1] ). 
Samples were balanced age (mean: 68 years old -Pick’s, 66 years old -control), PMI (mean: 15.98 hours – Pick’s, 12.78 hours - control) and tissue RNA integrity number (RIN; mean: 6.1 -Pick’s, 5.6 -controls) ( Table S2 [this file] ). 
Additional publicly available datasets were used throughout the study for validation or comparison ( Table S2 [this file] ; and Key Resources Table [rid=T1] ). 
One outlier sample was identified based on abnormal frequencies of major cell types and divergent gene expression patterns, and was removed from the analysis ( Table S2 [this file] ). 
While RIN, PMI and age were not significantly different between case and control subjects (Mann Whitney U test; Table S2 [this file] ); sex and brank bank were not evenly split across groups (UCSF brain bank –bvFTD = 70%, control = 12%; male sex –bvFTD = 62%, controls = 50% ( Table S2 [this file] ).",xlsx,Tau Pathology Drives Dementia Risk-Associated Gene Networks toward Chronic Inflammatory States and Immunosuppression,XML,,,,,,,

The values of excluded covariates showed balanced distributions between control and ASD ( Supplementary Fig. 1e [href=this file] ; Methods).
As expected, SNPs within the same haplotype blocks show similar allelic expression patterns ( Supplementary Fig. 1f [href=this file] and 1g [href=this file] ).
Although this database contains data from mostly non-neural tissues, genes manifesting ASE in our study showed significant overlap with those in dbMAE ( Supplementary Fig. 2a [href=this file] ). For example, the overlap between genes showing ASE in the two cortical regions, BA9 and BA41 is extremely high (odds ratio (OR)=221.00 and p-value<2.2e-16; Supplementary Fig. 2b [href=this file] ), whereas the degree of overlap between two more developmentally and evolutionarily distinct brain regions, cortex and cerebellum, is substantial, but lower than in the two more similar cortical regions (between BA9 and vermis: OR=49.00 and p-value<2.2e-16; between BA41 and vermis: OR=72.54 and p-value<2.2e-16).
For further external validation, we applied the specific methods and pipeline used in the primary analysis of GTEx ( Supplementary Fig. 2c [href=this file] ).
The distribution of expression of imbalanced alleles was significantly shifted lower than balanced alleles (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, p-value<2.0e-16, the means of log (RPSM): 0.37 vs 0.71; Supplementary Fig. 2d [href=this file] ). Genes showing evidence for ASE were also preferentially enriched for neuronal and astrocyte markers ( Fig. 2b [href=#F2] and Supplementary Fig. 2e [href=this file] ). Remarkably, across all three brain regions, ASE genes are enriched for genes previously shown to be down-regulated in postmortem brain from patients with ASD ( Supplementary Fig. 2f [href=this file] ).
Similar to controls, idiopathic ASD cases showed tissue specific ASE across the three brain regions ( Fig. 3a [href=#F3] , Supplementary Fig. 3a [href=this file] , and Supplementary Fig. 3b [href=this file] ).
Genes exhibiting control-specific ASE are significantly enriched for pathways related to growth cone and synapse ( Supplementary Fig. 3c [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 4 [href=#SD6] ). Though there are fewer idiopathic ASD-specific ASE genes than control-specific ASE genes, those showing idiopathic ASD-specific ASD are significantly enriched for pathways involved in transport ( Supplementary Fig. 3d [href=this file] and Supplementary Table 4 [href=#SD6] ). Genes exhibiting ASE in both idiopathic ASD and controls show significant enrichment in genes harboring ASD risk variants ( Supplementary Fig. 3e [href=this file] ; OR=1.68, p-value=5e-04 for ASD1; OR=3.83, p-value=0.001 for ASD2). However, control-specific and idiopathic ASD-specific ASE genes do not show any enrichment with either the rare ASD risk variants or common variants from GWAS data ( Supplementary Fig. 3e [href=this file] ).
Controls had a higher density of balanced alleles than ASD cases while idiopathic ASD cases showed more imbalanced alleles ( Supplementary Fig. 4a [href=this file] and Fig. 4a [href=#F4] ). However, controls showed significantly more major allele MAE for low frequency alleles (minor allele frequency (MAF)<0.05) compared to idiopathic ASD ( Supplementary Fig. 4b [href=this file] ). These patterns were recapitulated in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR) of the chromosome X ( Supplementary Fig. 4c [href=this file] ).
We next investigated whether the differential ASE pattern was related to the MAF genome-wide ( Fig. 4b [href=#F4] and Supplementary Fig. 4b [href=this file] ).
Although MAE SNPs were observed across the genome ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [href=this file] ), there was an approximately 2-fold enrichment on chromosome 15 harboring a number of known imprinted loci ( Supplementary Table 5 [href=#SD2] ). This genome-wide enrichment pattern persisted when SNPs were analyzed at individual genes ( Supplementary Fig. 6a [href=this file] and 6b [href=this file] ).
For example, genes showing minor allele MAE showed no overlap with astrocyte markers , PSD , or ASD-specific down-regulated genes ( Supplementary Fig. 6c [href=this file] ). Like genes that manifest ASE ( Fig. 2c [href=#F2] ), major allele MAE genes show significant enrichment with genes associated with the rare ASD risk variants ( Supplementary Fig. 6d [href=this file] ). However, MAE genes in control and ASD showed some enrichment with common variants from GWAS data of BPD and SCZ ( Supplementary Fig. 6d [href=this file] ).
This analysis identities only two genomic regions, 14q32 (chr14:101302,638–101,544,745) and 15q11 (chr15:25,223,730–25,582,395), which are known imprinted loci that have many small splice junctions ( Fig. 6 [href=#F6] ) and show continuous high expression ( Supplementary Fig. 7 [href=this file] ) as single transcript units .
The snoRNA targeting sites were located significantly proximal to alternatively spliced junctions of their target genes in ASD ( Supplementary Fig. 8a [href=this file] ), and their splicing changes show significant correlations with the expression changes of their specific snoRNAs ( Supplementary Fig. 8b [href=this file] and 8c [href=this file] ). When one snoRNA has two different targets, their splicing changes also show strong correlation ( Supplementary Fig. 8d [href=this file] ).
Compared with the previously published RNA-seq based genotyping methods by Quinn et al. , these genotyping parameters show much higher accuracy with sensitivity exceeding 95% ( Supplementary Fig. 1b [href=this file] ) and specificity in the range of 90–95% ( Supplementary Fig. 1c [href=this file] ; see Quinn at el. for accuracy tests).
We categorized our samples into European, Mexican, Asian, African, and ambiguous groups ( Supplementary Fig. 1d [href=this file] ).
In BA9 samples, the distributions of the covariate values were balanced between control and ASD ( Supplementary Fig. 1e [href=this file] ).
We calculated deviations of log (fold change) values (the beta values of allele covariate from the group based ASE identifications) per haplotype block in cortex and compared their distributions with normal distributions ( Supplementary Fig. 1f [href=this file] and 1g [href=this file] ). For further validation, we compared ASE genes identified in our study with those present in dbMAE ( https://mae.hms.harvard.edu/ [href=https://mae.hms.harvard.edu/] ) using Fisher’s exact test ( Supplementary Fig. 2a [href=this file] ). Like GTEx data, we calculated ASE rates per tissue ( Supplementary Fig. 2c [href=this file] ).
We compared their log (RPSM) values using KS tests ( Supplementary Fig. 2d [href=this file] ).
We visualized their distributions using ggplot2 R package ( http://ggplot2.org/ [href=http://ggplot2.org/] ) and compared them between control and idiopathic ASD at autosome ( Fig. 4a [href=#F4] and Supplementary Fig. 4b [href=this file] ) and chromosome X ( Supplementary Fig. 4c [href=#SD7] ).
For major and minor allele MAE SNPs, we visualized them on the different lines ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [href=this file] ).",docx,Profiling allele specific gene expression in brains from individuals with autism spectrum disorder reveals preferential minor allele usage - PMC,HTML,"(8MB, docx)",media p,/articles/instance/6750256/bin/NIHMS1534152-supplement-1.docx,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

To increase their SNP calling accuracy, we optimized bam files following the recommended GATK pipeline ( Supplementary Fig. 1a [href=this file] ).

For this gene set enrichment studies, we also used known imprinted genes ( www.geneimprint.com [href=http://www.geneimprint.com/] ), PSD , FMRP target , HuR target , and RBFOX1 target genes , cell marker genes (neuron, astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, microglia, and endothelial), expression up- and down-regulated genes in ASD cortex ( Supplementary Table 6 [href=this file] ). HuR target gene list was collected from photoactivatable ribonucleoside crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) data instead of RNA binding proteins immunoprecipitation complementary DNA array (RIP-chip) data since PAR-CLIP data identified RNA binding proteins binding sites more precisely than RIP-chip ( Supplementary Table 6 [href=this file] ).

See Supplementary Figure 1 [this file] for clinical details, treatment history and sample collections for all 19 patients. 
From the 19 patients included in this study we generated scWGS data from 19,454 cells (range 200-2015 cells per patient, Supplementary Figure 2 [this file] ) with mean coverage of 0.089X (range 0.002-0.392X per cell, Supplementary Figure 2). We inferred the clonal composition at the time of diagnosis based on copy number data ( Methods [rid=S11] ), with the aim of following these clones over time as patients received chemotherapy, maintenance therapies and experienced disease recurrences using cfDNA ( Supplementary Figure 3 [this file] ). 
We then merged cells from each clone and re-computed copy number at 10kb resolution using a new Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based copy number caller, ( Methods [rid=S11] ). improves the resolution of pseudobulk clone copy number profiles and enables more precise matching between copy number and SVs ( Supplementary Figure 4 [this file] ). 
For each patient, we constructed a panel of mutations comprising a mix of clonal and subclonal somatic SNVs/SVs (≥100 SVs per patient, Supplementary Figure 2 [this file] ) and a small number of germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for QC purposes. 
Clone-specific SVs inferred by scWGS analysis were present in all patients with at least 200 cells (18 patients, average n=144, range 29-361 Supplementary Figure 2 [this file] ). 
See Supplementary Figure 5 [this file] for the scWGS data for these 10 patients. For all patients, ctDNA VAF of truncal SVs decreased during initial chemotherapy, as patients responded to therapy with decreased burden and decreased serum CA-125 levels ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] & Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] ). All patients were positive for ctDNA at the time point closest to first recurrence (defined as average VAF across the panel exceeding LOD ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] & Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] )). In 6 patients with sufficient plasma samples, ctDNA was detected prior to clinically confirmed disease recurrence but subsequent to completion of initial chemotherapy: 002 (76 days), 004 (26 days), 009 (184 days), 045 (109 days), 075 (233 days), 081 (314 days) ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] & Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] ). 
Copy number profiles from these data were consistent with predictions derived from scWGS derived copy number profiles and ctDNA clone frequencies ( Supplementary Figure 7a [this file] – c [this file] ). In patient 045, the locus (chr19q) was enriched at baseline, and (chr1q) at recurrence ( Supplementary Figure 7d [this file] ), while in patient 107, and a region on chr20q were enriched at recurrence as expected ( Supplementary Figure 7e [this file] ). Clone frequencies across time for patient 045 showed highly similar patterns for SVs ( Supplementary Figure 7f [this file] ) and SNVs ( Supplementary Figure 7g [this file] ) and were consistent using these two distinct sets of genomic features for all patients ( Supplementary Figure 7h [this file] , R=0.93, p<10 , Pearson correlation). 
In 6/10 patients (002, 006, 014, 045, 081, 107; see Fig. 4 [rid=F4] & Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] ), multiple clones were detected in post-recurrence plasma samples, highlighting that chemo-resistance may be polyclonal in many patients. In 4 of these cases (009, 045, 081 and 107), clones that were not detected in cfDNA or were detected at minor frequencies at baseline became dominant at first recurrence, suggesting that although multiple clones may become chemo-resistant, some have relative fitness advantages in the context of treatment ( Fig. 4 [rid=F4] & Supplementary Figure 6 [this file] ). Notably, while the presence of multiple resistant clones was a common observation, the overall diversity, as quantified by Shannon entropy, decreased in the final timepoint relative to baseline in 8/9 cases (p=0.027, t-test, Supplementary Figure 6h [this file] ). The number of clones detected also decreased at the final time point relative to baseline (p=0.086, t-test, Supplementary Figure 6i [this file] ).",pdf,Tracking clonal evolution of drug resistance in ovarian cancer patients by exploiting structural variants in cfDNA,XML,,,,,,,

We also compared the mRNA expression of a panel of cellular lineage markers with MethylCIBERSORT estimates and found significant associations for multiple cell types (Supplementary Figure 1b [href=this file] ) even though they are derived from different samplings of the same tumour.
For nine of these we were able to compare our predictions of tumour purity with ABSOLUTE estimates and observed strong correlations and significantly lower error margins compared to LUMP and ESTIMATE (Supplementary Figure 2a, b [href=this file] ). Further, we observed a robust preservation of positive correlations between MethylCIBERSORT and marker expression pan-cancer (Supplementary Figure 2c [href=this file] ), again with the caveat that the samples were taken from different aliquots of the tumour. We therefore compared estimates pertaining to fresh frozen and matched FFPE samples ( = 21 from three tumours) and recorded very high correlations, indicating our method is applicable also to the archival material (Supplementary Figure 2d [href=this file] ).
Among the genomic alterations we identify (for a full list of predicted driver events see Supplementary Data 8 [href=this file0] ), it is likely that some establish, while others are selected for, in different immune microenvironments. The positive correlation between EGFR levels (which are themselves correlated with EGFR phosphorylation (activation), Supplementary Figure 3 [href=this file] ) and the glycolytic signature is maintained across TCGA when matched RPPA profiles and RNA-seq data are compared (Fig. 5f [href=#Fig5] ).
Signature features were derived from 450k profiles using the aforementioned heuristic (delta-Beta and FDR cutoffs) with a maximum of 100 features per cell type for a wide range of tumour types, using cell lines allocated to the corresponding tissue in GSE68379 [href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE68379] (Table S10 [href=this file] ) and the aforementioned infiltrating cell types.",pdf,Pan-cancer deconvolution of tumour composition using DNA methylation - PMC,HTML,"(14.4MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/6089972/bin/41467_2018_5570_MOESM1_ESM.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

The PWAS identified 13 genes whose -regulated brain protein levels were associated with AD at false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.05 ( Figure 1 [href=#F1] , Table 1 [href=#T1] , Extended Data Figure 1a [href=#F2] , Supplementary Table 2 [href=this file] ).
A confirmatory PWAS was performed using the same AD GWAS and an independent set of 152 human brain proteomes profiled from the dPFC ( Supplementary Table 1b [href=this file] ) . Correlation between the protein weights in the discovery and confirmatory datasets was high (median 0.85, interquartile range 0.21; Supplementary table 3 [href=this file] ). Ten of these 13 proteins could be tested and all 10 proteins replicated in the confirmatory PWAS ( Table 1 [href=#T1] ; Extended Data Figure 1b [href=#F2] ; Supplementary table 4 [href=this file] ).
We found 9 of 13 genes consistent with being causal ( Table 2 [href=#T2] ; Supplementary Table 5 [href=this file] ). SMR results suggest that the -regulated protein abundance mediates the association between genetic variants and AD for all these 13 genes, but HEIDI results argue against a causal role for 4 genes due to linkage disequilibrium ( Table 2 [href=#T2] ; Supplementary Table 6 [href=this file] ).
Full results for TWAS is in Supplementary tables 17 [href=this file] - 18 [href=this file] . “ ” in “TWAS significant” column refers to genes with 0.05 <TWAS nominal p <0.1. refers to genes not within 1Mb window of SNPs with p < 5E-08 identified in Jansen et. al.
That analysis found the 13 original PWAS-significant genes and 6 additional significant genes at FDR p<0.05 ( , , ; Supplementary table 7 [href=this file] ). Moreover, results from COLOC and SMR/HEIDI tests found the same evidence of causality as the original findings except that was now consistent with causality by both COLOC and SMR/HEIDI compared to mixed findings before ( Supplementary tables 8 [href=this file] - 9 [href=this file] ). The 6 additional genes were not consistent with being causal by COLOC ( Supplementary Table 8 [href=this file] ).
The PWAS of clinical AD identified 4 genes, ALS 7 genes, PD 17 genes, neuroticism 72 genes, height 662 genes, BMI 395 genes, and WHRadjBMI 244 genes ( Supplementary Tables 10 [href=this file] - 16 [href=this file] ).
The 888 transcriptomes were mainly from the frontal cortex donated by participants of European descent ( Supplementary table 1c [href=this file] ), and quality control was analogous to that of the proteomes to remove technical and clinical characteristics before estimating the effect of genetic variants on mRNA expression. The AD TWAS identified 40 genes whose genetically regulated mRNA expression levels were associated with AD at FDR p<0.05 ( Extended Data Figure 3 [href=#F4] ; Supplementary table 17 [href=this file] ). Among the 11 potentially causal genes identified at the protein-level, five genes, , , , , and showed at least nominal significance with similar directions of association with AD as seen at the protein-level ( Table 3 [href=#T3] ; Supplementary table 18a [href=this file] ).
For the 5 genes with evidence at both the transcript and protein levels, results from SMR test for two molecular traits suggested their protein abundance is mediated by mRNA expression ( Supplementary table 18a [href=this file] , b [href=this file] ). For the three genes with suggestive evidence for -regulated mRNA’s association with AD ( , , and ), only had evidence to suggest protein expression is mediated by mRNA expression level ( Supplementary table 18a [href=this file] , b [href=this file] ).
Using human single-cell RNA-sequencing data profiled from the dPFC we found cell-type specific enrichment for expression of 6 of the 11 causal genes at FDR p-value < 0.05 (adjusted for 17,775 genes). , , , and were enriched in excitatory neurons, whereas showed enrichment in oligodendrocytes and in astrocytes and microglia ( Extended Data Figure 4 [href=#F5] ; Supplementary table 19 [href=this file] ).

Additionally, we examined the memory usage of CWAS-Plus with an increasing number of samples and found an approximately linear increase ( Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ). 
Our observations revealed that variants from most clusters exhibited a higher percentage of variants in higher score bins than non-RNVs ( Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ), indicating that CWAS-Plus prioritized more pathogenic variants within the broader pool of noncoding variants. 
CWAS-Plus demonstrated significant case enrichment (OR = 1.3; = 5.7 10 , 95% CI: 1.1–1.6), while Sei, Enformer, and STAARpipeline showed no significant case enrichment ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] , Supplementary Table 6 [rid=sup2] ). 
CWAS analyses for variants showed highly consistent estimates between the variant-level and sample-level tests ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] , Supplementary Table 7 [rid=sup2] ). 
Our extended analysis comparing the ability to identify risk variants revealed that only CWAS-Plus demonstrated significant case enrichment in risk variant carriers, whereas Sei, Enformer, and STAARpipeline did not ( Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ).",docx,CWAS-Plus: estimating category-wide association of rare noncoding variation from whole-genome sequencing data with cell-type-specific functional data,XML,,,,,,,

CWAS analyses for variants showed highly consistent estimates between the variant-level and sample-level tests ( Supplementary Fig. 5 [rid=sup1] , Supplementary Table 7 [this file] ).

Samples were thawed at room temperature and protein concentrations measured by the bicinchoninic acid assay (BCA) method (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S2). 
The mass spectrometer was set to collect in PRM mode with an inclusion list consisting of each peptide (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S3). 
The summed product ions peak areas were considered as raw peptide peak area (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S3), which was normalized by external reference heavy peptide standards to correct for MS signal and sample loading variance (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S4). The sum of all peptides belonging to the same protein was calculated and normalized by the average of global pooled (GIS) samples (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S5). Protein normalized ratios were then regressed by age and gender, and centered to mean zero (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S6) prior to statistical analyses. 
For proteins, standard Student’s t-test, or one-way ANOVA test were used to calculate significance (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S7). 
In the discovery TMT dataset, the Bicor rho correlation, and Student’s significance p values, were calculated using the WGCNA R package using the bicor And P value function, comparing normalized protein sum of peptide measurements by MS to selected traits obtained on paired cases by ELISA measurements of total Tau, phospho-Tau (pT181), β-amyloid, and ratio of Tau/Aβ (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S8). 
These three logistic regression classifiers for each protein were trained using a five-fold cross validation procedure and the performance of these classifiers was assessed on the testing set using the AUC of the ROC curve (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S9). 
The latter group were cognitively impaired, but negative for Aβ and Tau biomarker status (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1 and S2).

The majority of the somatic mutations in these cultures displayed a variant allele frequency (VAF) clustered around 0.5, which indicates that these mutations were shared by all cells in the culture and therefore present in the originally expanded stem cell ( Figure S2 [href=this file] ). These accumulated mutations are discarded based on the low VAF ( Figure S2 [href=this file] ). We performed WGS on DNA from 18 HSCs/MPPs derived from adult marrow biopsies of 5 healthy donors, ranging from 26 to 63 years of age ( Table S1 [href=this file] ). Independent validations using single-molecule molecular inversion probes (smMIPs) of a subset of the identified somatic mutations revealed an overall confirmation rate of approximately 91% ( Tables S2 [href=this file] and S4 [href=#mmc3] B).
Nonetheless, cells of the same donor shared only a limited number of mutations (60 out of 11,082 base substitutions; Table S1 [href=this file] ), indicating that mutagenesis did occur independently during the lifetime of each assessed cell.
The strongest factor in our PCA (PC1) separates cells with either high or low contribution of signatures 1 or 5 ( Figure S3 [href=this file] ), which are signatures that were previously defined in a pan-cancer analysis ( Alexandrov et al., 2013b [href=#bib3] ) and reported to act in a “clock-like” manner.
Directions of signature contributions between samples are indicated on the x and y axis; see Figure S3 [href=this file] .
The presence of a third pattern, reflecting a recently defined signature 32 ( Inman et al., 2018 [href=#bib16] ), separates the mutation spectra in HSPCs from stem cells of the other human tissues (PC2; Figures 3 [href=#fig3] A and S3 [href=this file] ). Although the etiology of signature 32 is unknown, base substitutions specific for this signature were associated with a transcriptional strand bias in the HSPCs ( Figures 3 [href=#fig3] D and S4 [href=this file] ), consistent with activity of transcription-coupled repair ( Pleasance et al., 2010 [href=#bib32] ).
Remarkably, the absolute contribution of all three signatures to the base substitution load in normal HSPCs was similar as those in a previously reported acute myeloid leukemia (AML) dataset ( Welch et al., 2012 [href=#bib36] ; Figure 3 [href=#fig3] E; p = 0.97; chi-square test; Figure S4 [href=this file] B and S4C), indicating that the genesis of this malignancy does not necessarily require enhanced mutagenesis.
Sample B (26-year-old donor, male, white) was extracted at Boston Children’s Hospital, whereas samples A (33-year-old, male, white), C (55-year-old, female, hispanic), D (63-year-old, male, white), and E (41-year old, female, African American) were obtained from AllCells ( Table S1 [href=this file] ). 10-20 mL of whole bone marrow aspirate were drawn into a 60cc syringe containing heparin (80 U/mL of BM) from a unique puncture in the posterior iliac crest.
Representative examples of sorted populations are shown in the Figure S1 [href=this file] B.
When 70% or more of the reads with the same UMI had the same nucleotide, then the UMI was counted as valid as described( Yu et al., 2018 [href=#bib40] ) Mutation positions with less than 20 valid UMI’s were filtered out, and the rest mutations with higher than 0 VAF were counted as validated ( Table S2 [href=this file] ).",pdf,Somatic Mutations Reveal Lineage Relationships and Age-Related Mutagenesis in Human Hematopoiesis - PMC,HTML,"(2.1MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/6289083/bin/mmc1.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

The vast majority (> 95%) of European ancestry HD chrs carry a canonical CAG repeat region with an uninterrupted CAG repeat followed by CAACAG ( Figure 2 [rid=fig2] B; Table S1 [this file] ).

Four different meQTL mapping regression models were fit: (1) a “baseline” model to test for association between genetic variants and DNAm β-values across both smoking cases and controls; this model included age at death, sex, estimated non-neuronal cell-type proportion, PC1 for DNAm array negative control probes, PC1 for imputed genotypes, and PC2 for imputed genotypes as covariates (see Supplemental Methods [href=this file] for model selection details); (2) a smoking cases–only model similar to the baseline model; (3) a smoking controls–only model similar to the baseline model; and (4) an interaction model to test for associations of a genetic variant-by-smoking status interaction with DNAm β-values. Additional details of each model are provided in the Supplemental Methods [href=this file] .
The covariates included in each model were age at death, sex, exon mapping rate, ribosomal RNA mapping rate, PC1 for imputed genotypes, PC2 for imputed genotypes, and four latent variables estimated by PEER v1.3 to account for additional unmeasured sources of confounding (see Supplemental Methods [href=this file] for model selection details).
For a given probe, the colocalization test region spanned all genetic variants that were 1) included in the meQTL mapping for the probe and 2) tested in the GSCAN GWAS ( Figure S1 [href=this file] ).

We observed strong enrichment in predicted enhancer states, as well as H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me2 marks, indicating that HARs are enriched in developing brain enhancers, more so than in adult brain (Supplementary Fig. 1b, c [this file] ). Further, HARs were enriched in regulatory elements that were significantly more likely to be accessible in the germinal (neurogenic) zones of the developing cortex , highlighting their potential role in cortical neurogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 1d [this file] ). 
We were able to assign 638 and 717 HARs to 972 and 1021 genes using contacts defined by three-dimensional chromatin conformation in cortical plate (CP, neocortical laminae containing post-mitotic neurons) and germinal zone (GZ, neocortical laminae consisting primarily of neural progenitors) in the fetal brain, respectively (Methods; Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] ) . When combined with intragenic HARs, we were able to assign 1028 HARs to 1648 putative target genes (Supplementary Tables 1 [this file] – 2 [this file] , Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] , subsequently referred to as putative target genes for HARs). 
The putative target genes of HARs are enriched for genes that regulate pathways involved in human brain development, regionalization, dorsal-ventral patterning, cortical lamination, and proliferation of neuronal progenitors (Fig. 1d [rid=Fig1] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ), suggesting that multiple aspects of human brain development are subject to human-specific regulation. 
Although this overlap is significant ( = 2.09 × 10 , OR = 2.5, Fisher’s exact test) and implicates a high confidence core set of target genes (Supplementary Table 1 [this file] ), most target genes are discordant (Fig. 1c [rid=Fig1] ), which may be due to differences between tissue specific gene regulation, or methodologic factors. 
We found that HARs interacted with 823 and 467 protein-coding genes in ES cells and IMR90 cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b [this file] ). The majority of genes (~60%) interacted with HARs in a cell type-specific manner, again highlighting the cell type specific nature of chromatin interactions, consistent with the notion of tissue specific gene regulation (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] ). Notably, many genes known to play major roles in cerebral cortex development and dorsal–ventral/anterior–posterior pattern specification, including , , , , , and , interacted with HARs in the developing cortex (Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ), consistent with the model that chromatin contact maps in developing brain will likely provide more biologically relevant targets for human brain evolution than other tissues. 
Also check Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] . 
In contrast, HGEs interact with genes involved in collagen metabolism, TOR signaling, immune function, and lipid storage, and HLEs interact with genes involved in oxygen transport, autophagy, and thymus development (Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] ). 
HGE- and HLE-associated genes show a pattern of more gradual upregulation throughout prenatal development, manifesting their highest expression after the peak of neuronal migration, during the period of synaptic formation and gliogenesis (Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] ). 
Indeed, HAR-, HGE -, and HLE-associated genes are also under purifying selection when compared with the genome background (Methods; Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). 
Genes associated with other human evolved elements do not show any deviation of expression -scores, indicating that they do not show stage-specific enrichment in human compared with rhesus macaque (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
HAR - and HLE-associated genes do not exhibit significant changes in breakpoints in the genes they regulate (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ), indicating that the activity of different classes of human evolved regulatory elements manifest distinct developmental trajectories. 
Indeed, we observed that HAR- and HGE -associated genes are enriched with LoF-intolerant genes that harbor de novo mutations in ASD (ASD constrained genes) and DD risk genes (Fig. 2f [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). Relative to HGE , genes putatively regulated by HARs show more enrichment in ASD constrained genes and de novo LOF variation, whereas HGE appear more enriched for constrained DD genes, or genes harboring LOF mutations in DD (Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] . 
However, HAR genes appear more likely to be disrupted in ASD, while HGE genes are more substantially enriched in constrained or LOF DD genes although enriched in constrained ASD genes (Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
This leads to a set of 10,000 ORs for each tissue type, which was plotted in Supplementary Fig. 1a [this file] . 
As some of these regions were overlapping, we ended up having 109,408 randomly selected genomic regions with matched GC content and length as HARs (Supplementary Table 4 [this file] ), which we used to construct a null distribution. 
Human-specific genes were obtained from Bakken et al. (Table S10 [this file] ), Sousa et al. (Table S5 [this file] ), and Brawand et al. (Table S1 [this file] ). 
To further confirm that this enrichment is not merely due to their genomic features, we performed a disease enrichment analysis for HAR-associated genes compared with other genes associated with evolutionary conserved elements (3,083,588 evolutionary conserved elements with phastCons score >0.40 (similar to most HARs) were mapped to 16,676 protein-coding genes), and HGE -associated genes over genes associated with fetal brain enhancers (186,304 enhancers reported in Reilly et al. were mapped to total 15,693 protein-coding genes), where we obtained similar results (Supplementary Fig. 5c [this file] ). 
To experimentally validate Hi-C predicted candidate target genes of HARs, we chose HARs that (1) overlap with H3K27ac marks in fetal brain and (2) interact with developmentally important genes expressed in human neural progenitors (Supplementary Fig. 8 [this file] ), and that are 3) predicted to regulate only one gene. RNA was extracted by miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) and the expression level of putative target genes ( , , and ) was measured by qPCR (LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master, Roche) and normalized to . gRNA and primer sequences for both genomic DNA and qPCR are described in Supplementary Table 3 [this file] .

In our aged mouse HMPV model, aged mock-infected CD4 T cells had increased expression compared with young CD4 T cells, but there was no difference in CD19 B cells ( Supplemental Fig. 1A [href=this file] ). We also found that upregulation of PD-1 during HMPV infection was specific to CD8 T cells with no difference in PD-1 on CD4 T or CD19 B cells between young and aged HMPV-infected mice ( Supplemental Fig 1B [href=this file] ). PD-1 expression robustly increased with infection in young mice but stayed elevated in aged mice in both mock and HMPV infection ( Fig. 1E [href=#fig01] ). scRNAseq data revealed no difference in (TIM-3), , or (2B4) inhibitory receptor expression on CD8 T cells ( Supplemental Fig. 1C [href=this file] – 1E [href=this file] ), which we confirmed at the protein level in mock-infected mice via flow cytometry ( Supplemental Fig. 1F [href=this file] ).
There were no significant differences in PD-L1 or PD-L2 expression between ages in mock- or HMPV-infected groups across numerous innate immune cell types ( Fig. 1I [href=#fig01] and Supplemental Fig. 1G [href=this file] ), with the exception of a small increase in PD-L2 expression in aged mock interstitial macrophages ( Supplemental Fig. 1G [href=this file] ). We also found no difference between ages in (PD-L1) ( Fig. 1J [href=#fig01] ) or in (PD-L2) ( Supplemental Fig. 1H [href=this file] ) in the lung myeloid cell scRNAseq dataset ( 8 [href=#r8] ).
PD-1 blockade had no significant impact on the production of HMPV-specific lung CD8 T cells, based on tetramer staining with the HMPV viral epitope H2-D/K N (N11) ( Fig. 2D [href=#fig02] , 2E [href=#fig02] ), and also did not impact the T CD8 T cells that expressed TOX and EOMES ( Fig. 2F [href=#fig02] , 2G [href=#fig02] ; Supplemental Fig. 1I [href=this file] – 1K [href=this file] ).
We confirmed PD-1 expression was absent on CD8 T cells ( Supplemental Fig. 2A [href=this file] ). There was no significant difference in weight loss ( Supplemental Fig. 2B [href=this file] ) or viral titer ( Supplemental Fig. 2C [href=this file] ) in aged mice. No difference was seen in TIM-3 expression between aged and WT mice ( Supplemental Fig. 2D [href=this file] , 2E [href=this file] ). However, LAG-3 expression was increased ( Supplemental Fig. 2F [href=this file] , 2G [href=this file] ) on CD8 tet T cells. PD-1 absence did not significantly affect the expression levels or absolute cell numbers of CD44 and CD62L on CD8 T cells ( Supplemental Fig. 2H [href=this file] , 2K [href=this file] ). We found no significant differences in the frequency or absolute cell number of CD4 Foxp3 , T-bet , GATA3 ( Supplemental Fig. 2I [href=this file] , 2L [href=this file] ), or Th1/Th2 ratio between genotypes ( Supplemental Fig. 2J [href=this file] ).
We next assessed whether this increase in CD8 T cell function was comparable to the increase in function we observed in young T cells compared with young WT T cells both in this study and in our previous studies ( Supplemental Fig. 2M [href=this file] ) ( 12–15 [href=#r12] ).
We confirmed the identity of transplanted T cells by assessing PD-1 expression on CD45.2 CD8 T cells ( Supplemental Fig. 3A [href=this file] ). There was no difference in weight loss or viral burden between the four groups ( Supplemental Fig. 3B [href=this file] , 3C [href=this file] ). We also assessed engraftment of recipient (CD45.1) and donor (CD45.2) total CD3 lymphocytes, CD4 T cells, and CD8 T cells ( Supplemental Fig. 3D [href=this file] ). lymphocytes engrafted better than B6 lymphocytes ( Supplemental Fig. 3D [href=this file] – 3G [href=this file] ), especially in bulk CD3 ( Supplemental Fig. 3E [href=this file] ) and CD8 T lymphocytes ( Supplemental Fig. 3G [href=this file] ), as previously observed ( 15 [href=#r15] ).
To remove irradiation as a confounding variable, we performed an adoptive transfer of young or aged CD8 T cells into young recipients along with young WT CD4 T cells and B cells ( Supplemental Fig. 4A [href=this file] ). When we compared the function of young and aged CD8 T cells in this model, we observed that young CD8 T cells were still more functional in granzyme B and IFN-γ production than aged CD8 T cells ( Supplemental Fig. 4B [href=this file] – 4D [href=this file] ).

Figures S1–S5,local-data,mmc1,No description,Document  S1.  Figures  S1–S5,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"See also Figure S1 [this file] . 
For further validation, by randomizing the set of tropisms, the LDA loses all its discriminating power ( Figure S1 [this file] A). Supporting the robustness of the clustering, we obtained the same performance by using another reduced list of human viruses from ViralZone ( Hulo et al., 2011 [rid=bib34] ; Figure S1 [this file] B; Table S1 [rid=mmc2] ). 
As shown in Figure S1 [this file] , we observed that RNA folding, as determined by the minimum free energy, was also non-randomly distributed among tropisms. 
This analysis was replicated with the other list of viruses from ViralZone, leading to comparable predictive outcomes ( Figure S2 [this file] ; p < 0.01, permutation test in Table S2 [rid=mmc3] ). In concordance, a LDA of the average SDA of each virus across tissues can similarly separate different clusters of viral tropism based on their translational efficiencies ( Figure S2 [this file] ). 
See also Figures S2–S5 [this file] . 
The results showed similar predictive performances compared to TCGA ( Figure S3 [this file] ). 
As a result, we observed that the SARS-CoV-2 proteome is especially adapted to the upper respiratory airways and alveoli but also to other tissues such as the gastrointestinal tract and brain ( Figures S4 [this file] and S5 [this file] ; Table S3 [rid=mmc4] ; see STAR Methods [rid=sec4] ). 
However, as suggested by Figure S1 [this file] , many other and overlapping forces, such as mRNA stability, frameshift motifs, transcriptional regulation, or codon-dependent immune responses, are also known to shape the composition of coding sequences ( Bergman and Tuller, 2020 [rid=bib10] ; Li et al., 2012 [rid=bib39] ). 
In particular, we found that SARS-CoV-2 is highly adapted to the upper respiratory tract and the alveoli ( Figure S4 [this file] C), which is in agreement with recent single-cell transcriptomic studies reporting the expression of ACE2 in the nasal goblet and ciliated cells as well as the type-2 alveolar epithelial cells ( Sungnak et al., 2020 [rid=bib66] ; Ziegler et al., 2020 [rid=bib83] ). In terms of the evolution of the new coronavirus, given the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 SDA with the phylogenetically closest bat coronavirus ( Figure S5 [this file] B), it seems that a translational selection to increase SDA would have acted before the putative zoonosis from bats or other intermediate hosts. 
We assigned each virus to its corresponding tropism ( Table S1 [rid=mmc2] ) in order to find the linear combination of tissue adaptation features that maximized differences between viral target tissues ( Figure S2 [this file] ; Table S2 [rid=mmc3] ). 
We then computed the SDA of viral proteins from the three pandemic coronaviruses of the last two decades SARS-CoV ( Drosten et al., 2003 [rid=bib19] ), MERS-CoV ( Zaki et al., 2012 [rid=bib75] ), and SARS-CoV-2 ( Zhou et al., 2020a [rid=bib81] ), as well as the common flu-causing influenza A virus (H1N1) along the respiratory tract ( Figure S4 [this file] A). For this reason, we also extended our translational analysis to all the 23 tissues of the TCGA dataset ( Figure S5 [this file] A). 
Moreover, given that the tropisms not only depend on the translational adaptation to the host, but also on the expression of the required entry receptors, we measured the respective receptors of each virus ( Figure S4 [this file] B; Table S3 [rid=mmc4] ). 
In an attempt to elucidate the translational selection that could have benefitted the evolution of the new coronavirus, we also compared the SDA adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 to those of close phylogenetic strains ( Figure S5 [this file] B): the human-infecting SARS-CoV and the bat coronavirus RatG13, with 79.6% and 96.2% of sequence identity, respectively ( Zhou et al., 2020a [rid=bib81] ).",pdf,Translational adaptation of human viruses to the tissues they infect,XML,,,,,,,

Supporting the robustness of the clustering, we obtained the same performance by using another reduced list of human viruses from ViralZone ( Hulo et al., 2011 [rid=bib34] ; Figure S1 [rid=mmc1] B; Table S1 [this file] ).

This analysis revealed significant correlations between the two data modalities, suggesting that immunofluorescent staining can be reliably combined with the Visium ST protocol ( Supplementary Figure 2a [this file] – d [this file] ). 
Comparing layer-specific transcriptional signatures derived from our dataset with those derived from a published DLPFC ST dataset with H&E-based manual layer annotation showed a strong correlation, confirming the concordance of our clustering-based annotation with classical histopathological annotation ( Supplementary Figure 3a [this file] ) . Furthermore, using our layer annotations and plaque locations, we found a higher rate of plaques in the deeper layers (L4 - L6) compared to the upper layers (L1 - L3), ( Supplementary Table 2 [rid=SD3] ; Supplementary Figure 3b [this file] – e [this file] ), similar to previously published results . 
Metallothioneins showed the highest transcription levels in the nuclei of astrocytes, although they were also transcribed by other cell types at lower levels ( Supplementary Figure 4a [this file] ). The upregulated gene was almost exclusively transcribed by astrocytes in our human gray matter DLPFC data ( Supplementary Figure 4a [this file] ). 
The predicted abundances of excitatory neuronal subpopulations reflected the cortical laminar structure, consistent with the layer-specific annotations of these subpopulations from the Allen Brain Map ( Supplementary Figure 5a [this file] – d [this file] ). Consistently, Ast.5 exhibited a reactive-like transcription signature in the snRNA-seq data with high levels of and expression ( Supplementary Figure 4b [this file] ), two of the four genes significantly upregulated at neuritic plaques . 
At a cellular level, astrocytes are known to exhibit the highest levels of metallothionein expression in the human brain ( Supplementary Figure 4 [this file] ), but other cell types may also contribute.

All ENCODE accessions used are listed in Supplementary Table S2 [this file] . 
Experiments used from ChIP-Atlas are listed in Supplementary Table S3 [this file] . 
We then calculate the fraction of unique peaks shown in Figure 1 [rid=F1] A and Supplementary Figure S2 [this file] as: 
All ChIP-seq targets and cell types used in Epitome are listed in Supplementary Table S2 [this file] . 
However, Epitome can make predictions in a query cellular context using other assays that measure chromatin accessibility, such as ATAC-seq (see Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] ). 
This maximum genomic distance of 12 kb was determined through hyperparameter search using validation chromosome 7 (See Supplementary Figure S12a [this file] ). Without the CASV, Epitome is not able to provide cell type specific predictions for , as shown in Supplementary Figure S12a [this file] . 
However, ATAC-seq can also be used to compute the CASV (See Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] ). 
Training on multiple cell types allows Epitome to generalize well to new cell types, and allows Epitome to achieve similar precision to methods that see the cell type being evaluated during training ( Supplementary Figures S10 and S11 [this file] ). This procedure is visualized in Supplementary Figure S4 [this file] , where at each iteration, the choice of cell types used in and the cell type used for are rotated through until the model has converged. 
Supplementary Figure S16 [this file] visualizes changes in validation and training loss for a subset of 18 ChIP-seq targets in a joint Epitome model trained for 2000 iterations, where training loss is calculated as the mean sigmoid cross entropy across 10 000 randomly selected training regions, and the validation loss is calculated as the mean sigmoid cross entropy across all 200 bp regions on chromosome 7 that have epigenetic signal from at least one of the 18 ChIP-seq targets. 
For Epitome, we found 5 and 0 to be the most optimal patience and min-delta, respectively, after tuning and comparing the hyperparameters shown in Supplementary Figure S15b [this file] . 
Supplementary Figure S15a [this file] compares the model accuracy (auPRC) with and without the early stopping method on 85 ChIP-seq targets. 
Information regarding each algorithm and the features used for each method are listed in Supplementary Table S1 [this file] . We compared these methods by predicting binding sites for 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers in 40 held out cell lines, tissues, and primary cells, enumerated in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . 
We additionally used motifs published by Kheradpour ( 50 [rid=B50] ), available at http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/ (http://compbio.mit.edu/encode-motifs/) (See Supplementary Table S5 [this file] for a list of motifs used). 
All combinations considered are listed in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . In total, we trained 323 DeFCoM models. auPRC and pAUC scores for both methods can be found in Supplementary Table S7 [this file] . 
Therefore, we only compare Epitome and DeFCoM in regions overlapping motifs, shown in Figure 2 [rid=F2] B and Supplementary Figure S8 [this file] . 
This is demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S7 [this file] , which shows comparisons of pAUC and auPRC when evaluated on all 200 bp regions on chromosomes 8 and 9. While it is generally a simple classification problem to predict nonbinding in genomic loci with no measured regulatory activity, it is harder to predict nonbinding in regions that have some epigenetic signal. pAUC and auPRC values used to generate Figure 2 [rid=F2] using this sampling technique on chromosomes 8 and 9 can be found in Supplementary Table S8 [this file] . Example ROC and PR curves are shown in Supplementary Figure S9 [this file] . 
We used all motifs as those used to train DeFCoM, available in Cis-BP database and Kheradpour ( 49 [rid=B49] , 50 [rid=B50] ) ( Supplementary Table S5 [this file] ). 
Evaluations of Epitome and DeepSEA are shown in Supplementary Figures S10 and S11 [this file] . We selected all 200 bp regions for evaluation as defined in Defining the test set to compare Epitome, Catchitt and Avocado. pAUC and auPRC values used to generate Supplementary Figure S10 [this file] can be found in Supplementary Table S9 [this file] . 
Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] shows the ratio of ChIP-seq peaks that do not overlap any motif for a TF or chromatin modifier of interest. We considered all motifs specified in Supplementary Table S5 [this file] . TFs, chromatin modifiers, and cell types evaluated are listed in Supplementary Table S6 [this file] . Ratios used to generate Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] can be found in Supplementary Table S10 [this file] . 
Heatmaps shown in Supplementary Figure S12 [this file] were generated using Seaborn ( 53 [rid=B53] ). 
Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] shows that Epitome models that are trained on DNase-seq and validated using ATAC-seq perform comparably when validated using DNase-seq. 
listed in Supplementary Table S4 [this file] . 
We therefore compared Epitome and DeFCoM by evaluating the ability of each method to predict TFBS overlapping motifs for 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers across 40 cell lines, primary cells, and tissues ( Supplementary Table S6 [this file] ). 
This is demonstrated in Supplementary Figure S5 [this file] , which shows that the ratio of ChIP-seq peaks that do not overlap any motif for a TF in question can range from 0.45 to 1.0 for the 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers we evaluated (see Evaluation of motif overlap of ChIP-seq peaks for 77 transcription factors and chromatin modifiers in 40 cell types). To compare to these methods, we first evaluated chromosome wide predictions of Epitome, Avocado, and Catchitt, on all 77 TFs and chromatin modifiers across 40 cell lines, primary cells, and tissues ( Supplementary Figure S6 [this file] ) on held-out chromosomes 8 and 9 in Figure 2A [rid=F2] , for a total of 264 comparisons. While joint Epitome models perform similarly in terms of pAUC and better for many instances in terms of auPRC compared to single Catchitt models ( Supplementary Figure S6a [this file] ), Avocado performs poorest on these metrics (Figure 2A [rid=F2] ). Supplementary Figure S6b [this file] additionally shows that for many cases, single Epitome models perform better than jointly trained Epitome models. As shown in Supplementary Figure S16 [this file] , different ChIP-seq targets trained in a joint model converge at different iterations during training. 
Supplementary Figure S10 [this file] shows that even though DeepSEA trains using a given test cell line and Epitome does not, Epitome performs comparably to DeepSEA in both pAUC and auPRC. Supplementary Figure S11 [this file] show receiver operating characteristic curves and precision-recall curves for these methods in all four held out cell lines from ENCODE. 
This observation is most easily observed in change in AUC as wider genomic contexts are considered, shown in Supplementary Figure S12a [this file] . Supplementary Figure S12b and c [this file] shows that when histone modifications are trained on more than 10 cell types, performance decreases as wider genomic contexts are considered. 
This is also a common use case that a query cellular context has been partially characterized with multiple experiments, including chromatin accessibility and various histone modifications ( Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] ). 
Although the Epitome model primarily uses DNase-seq to compute the CASV and train its models, we show in Supplementary Figure S14 [this file] that Epitome can accurately predict histone modifications and TFBS when using ATAC-seq during evaluation in the CASV when Epitome has been trained using DNase-seq. 
Figure 5D [rid=F5] and Supplementary Figure S13a [this file] show Epitome predictions for H3K27ac at 72 h in peak and non-peak regions respectively. 
Figure 1 [rid=F1] A and Supplementary Figure S1 [this file] similarly show that across 152 ChIP-seq and DNase-seq experiments, the fraction of unique peaks discovered in each cell type used in Epitome decreases as more cell types are characterized for a given experiment. 
These results are shown in Supplementary Figure S3 [this file] , and show that many histone modifications, including H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and H3K4me1 and H3K4me2, are frequently collected, along with at least one other additional ChIP-seq target of interest. 
As shown in Figure 2 [rid=F2] and Supplementary Figure S6b [this file] , models that are trained individually on epigenetic events of interest often outperform models trained jointly.",zip,Epitome: predicting epigenetic events in novel cell types with multi-cell deep ensemble learning,XML,,,,,,,

Figures  S1–S6  and  Table  S1,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"Finally, instead of using a supporting read threshold to filter as most methods do, Anchored-fusion incorporates a model with a deep neural network called the HVLD model to filter out false positive fusions that may be caused by artificial factors during the experimental process ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] B and S1 [this file] ). 
For example, the classical BCR-ABL1 fusion gene contains a 47 bp short homologous sequence with chromosome 5 near its fusion breakpoint, which causes some supporting evidences at that location to be incorrectly matched or filtered out due to multiple alignments ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] C and S2 [this file] ). As a result, the supporting sequencing reads of the DUX4 fusion gene are matched to hundreds of loci, leading to few supporting evidences or even the erroneous removal of the fusion event ( Figures 1 [rid=fig1] D and S3 [this file] ). 
For all test cases, we took the real fusions downloaded from Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes as positive samples ( Figure S4 [this file] ). 
The fusion breakpoints identified by each tool among the fusion partners are listed in Table S1 [this file] . 
The fusion gene with the breakpoint at 1,905,943 is derived from RRMM1 and RRMM2, and the one with the breakpoint at nucleotide 1,902,353 is derived from SMM0 ( Figures 6 [rid=fig6] B and S5 [this file] ). 
The specific process of obtaining training and testing data is shown in Figure S4 [this file] . 
Randomly selecting negative samples and using the entire set for training showed no significant differences in performance. ( Figure S6 [this file] ).",pdf,Anchored-fusion enables targeted fusion search in bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data,XML,,,,,,,

Figures S1–S9,local-data,mmc1,No description,Document  S1.  Figures  S1–S9,supplementary material,.//supplementary-material,"By extension, compounds targeting the same proteins should induce similar transcriptional signatures, which in turn can shed insight into its MoA ( Figure S1 [this file] ). 
The most comprehensive such evaluation to date, the Kinome-Binding Resource (KBR), measured the affinity of 230 clinically relevant kinase inhibitors across 255 kinases. [xref] [rid=bib18] While restricted to this protein class, this dataset is well-suited to benchmarking methods aimed at predicting drug polypharmacology by providing criteria for the evaluation of systems pharmacology approaches ( Figure S2 [this file] ). 
Interestingly, SC1 and SC2 scores revealed distinct distribution profiles: on average, most predictions were statistically significantly enriched on the top 10 target metric (SC1) but not on the entire list enrichment (SC2) ( Figures S3 [this file] A and S3B) 
Figures S3 [this file] C and 3D summarize the results of this analysis, with each box showing a team’s bootstrapped scores, and the color of the box indicating the Bayes factor relative to the top performer. Using this criteria, Team Atom and Team Netphar were confirmed as the top performers in SC1 and SC2, respectively ( Figures S3 [this file] C and S3D), while team SBNB was a close second in SC2 (Bayes factor 3–5). 
This analysis ( Figures S3 [this file] E and S3F) changed the ranking of some teams in SC1, most notably Team Theragen, whose original second place fell to ninth place when non-KBR targets were not pre-filtered. 
To better understand the models and the difference in their performances, we examined sub-challenge scores on an individual drug basis ( Figures S3 [this file] G and S3H). 
To address this question, we evaluated the ratio between the scores of the top three winning teams when either DrugBank or KBR targets were used as bona fide high-affinity targets of the 32 drugs used in the challenge ( Figure S4 [this file] ). While the scores based on DrugBank targets were consistently higher (Netphar, 3:2; SBNB, 4:2; and Atom, 1.7:1.4), they all showed positive enrichment within the prediction vector ( Figure S4 [this file] ). 
We compared the ranked performance of each prediction using these various databases as gold standards (KBR/Kinome, ChEMBL, DrugTargetCommons, KinomeScan, and DrugBank) to evaluate the stability of the predictions with different ground truths ( Figure S5 [this file] ). 
To evaluate the general relationships between kinase targets and mRNA programs, we assessed the correlation of the KBR-reported with transcriptional hallmarks (as detailed in Supplemental information [this file] ) across 84 drugs present in both databases ( Figure 4 [rid=fig4] D). 
Drug sensitivity training data was obtained from DrugComb, a curated database that includes batch-corrected drug sensitivities for both single drugs and drug combinations. [xref] [rid=bib27] In addition to the commonly used IC (half maximum inhibitory concenration), DrugComb provides an AUC-based relative inhibition (RI) metric, [xref] [rid=bib35] which captures both the potency and efficacy of drug responses ( Figure S6 [this file] A). 
Examining correlations between predicted and gold-standard targets, we found that adding drug sensitivity data significantly improved prediction accuracy relative to transcriptional data alone ( Figure S6 [this file] B). Performance improvements were driven by several individual drugs whose targets were poorly predicted based on perturbational profile data only, including sunitinib, crizotinib, and crenolanib ( Figure S6 [this file] C). 
This addresses two major reasons for clinical trial failures: lack of safety and efficacy. [xref] [rid=bib37] [xref] [rid=bib38] Failure rates may be substantially reduced if compound MoAs could be assessed more accurately and comprehensively ( Figures S1 [this file] A and S1B). 
Most of the experimental approaches rely on direct binding assays, such as ATP competitive pull-down, [xref] [rid=bib18] affinity purification [xref] [rid=bib39] [xref] [rid=bib40] or affinity chromatography assays. [xref] [rid=bib41] These labor-intensive methods are generally limited to the identification of high-affinity binding targets rather than the full protein repertoire responsible for compound activity in a tissue and are often restricted to a specific protein family, such as protein kinases ( Figure S1 [this file] A). Thus, critically relevant targets outside of these relatively narrow confines may be missed, as shown by the recent reclassification of the MET tyrosine receptor kinase inhibitor tivantinib as a microtubule inhibitor. [xref] [rid=bib42] Indeed, drug polypharmacology is emerging as a critical concept that increasingly impacts the mechanistic understanding of a drug’s disease-specific impact, for instance via a field effect mediated by multiple targets rather than by their primary, high-affinity binding target ( Figure S1 [this file] B). 
More recently, systematic gene expression profiling (GEP) following compound perturbations in cell lines [xref] [rid=bib8] [xref] [rid=bib11] [xref] [rid=bib23] [xref] [rid=bib50] has furthered the development of computational methods for MoA analysis ( Figure S1 [this file] B). 
The objective benchmark used in this challenge is the Kinome-Binding Resource (KBR), a systematic set of ATP-competitive binding assays assessing the ability of 230 candidate kinase inhibitor molecules to bind to one of 255 protein kinases ( Figure S2 [this file] ). 
A critical issue emerging from the evaluation of individual prediction performance and individual databases is that the concept of is still poorly defined and inconsistent ( Figure S2 [this file] ). 
Indeed, the fact that the perturbational signature significantly contributed to correct target inference suggests that downstream transcriptional regulators represent a valuable reporter assay that can distinguish the MoA of different compounds ( Figures 4 [rid=fig4] and S6 [this file] ). 
While we did not observe major differences between model performances based on modeling strategy, generally, similarity-weighted average methodologies performed best in SC2 ( Figures S7 [this file] and S8 [this file] ), while neural-network-based methodologies performed best in SC1 ( Figure S9 [this file] ). 
In the post-challenge phase of this study, we re-evaluated the performance of each team ( Figure S3 [this file] ) by repeating this analysis but omitting the kinase filtering step described above.

In order to optimize the clinical translation potential of the perturbation databases, we used the CMax, defined as the maximum plasma concentration after the administration of the drug at the maximum tolerated dose in patients, (whenever available from published pharmacokinetic studies), as an upper bound for the perturbation studies ( Table S1 [this file] ). 
Sidebar annotations of canonical drug-targets were defined based on the DrugBank definitions of drug-targets as detailed in Table S1 [this file] . 
To better understand the type of inhibitors that models performed the best on we calculated the enrichment of each drugbank target kinases (as defined in Table S1 [this file] ) over the ranked 32-drug vector in Figures 4 [rid=fig4] A and 4B using the aREA algorithm in the viper package in R.

On average, each tissue contained 66,395 cells (ranging from 2,638 cells in PBMCs to 287,269 in the heart) and 24,064 genes (ranging from 13,714 genes in PBMCs to 33,694 in the heart and kidney) ( Supplementary Table S1 [this file] ).

Major cell type significant gene markers.,SD1,,"From the snRNAseq data, we identified major cell types across all three regions from all donors, including oligodendrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), astrocytes, ependymal cells, microglia, macrophages, vascular cells, glutamatergic neurons and GABAergic neurons ( Fig 1E [href=#F1] , 1F [href=#F1] and Table S1 [href=this file] ). We observed oligodendrocyte and CD44-high astrocyte enrichment in the white matter adjacent to cortical gray matter ( Fig. 1I [href=#F1] ), and also confirmed that our cortical glutamatergic neuron subsets ( Table S2 [href=this file] ) localized to grey matter layers predicted by Azimuth human motor cortex reference ( Fig 1J [href=#F1] and 1K [href=#F1] ).
In donors with primary or secondary demyelination, however, we found only the GABA_6_CCK_LAMP5 subtype lower in the DLPFC in donors with primary demyelination and secondary demyelination ( Fig. 2A [href=#F2] , 2B [href=#F2] Table S3 [href=this file] ).
From a global perspective, we identified genes such as Myelin basic protein ( ) and Alpha-crystallin B ( ) differentially expressed in oligodendrocytes between control and demyelination groups ( Fig 2E [href=#F2] , Table S4 [href=this file] ). We then clustered oligodendrocytes into subgroups ( Fig 2F [href=#F2] , 2G [href=#F2] , Table S5 [href=this file] ) and examined compositional differences across brain regions and demyelination states ( Table S6 [href=this file] ). Genes distinguishing this Oligo_0_MOBP compared to other oligodendrocyte subgroups showed enrichment of expression programs related to cellular morphogenesis and axonogenesis ( Fig S1A [href=#SD2] , Table S7 [href=this file] ), suggesting a myelinating phenotype for this subgroup.
Analysis of these two subgroups showed enrichment of marker genes associated with distress or dysregulation by means of active protein folding, response to temperature stimulus and response to unfolded protein ( Fig S1B [href=#SD2] , S1C [href=#SD2] , Table S8 [href=this file] and S9 [href=this file] ).
We next performed the same analysis on oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), where we identified subgroups and genes differentially abundant between control and demyelination groups ( Fig 2M [href=#F2] , 2N [href=#F2] , 2O [href=#F2] , Table S10 [href=this file] , S11 [href=this file] ). In our MS donors, we observed higher proportions of subgroup OPC_2_TPST1_ARHGEF3 in NAWM; this subgroup showed enrichment of expression programs related to cell projection organization ( Fig 2P [href=#F2] , S1J [href=#SD2] , Table S12 [href=this file] ).
Taking all microglia together, we identified genes - including and - differentially expressed between control and both demyelination groups ( Fig 3A [href=#F3] , Table S13 [href=this file] ), which also distinguish subgroups of microglia identified by clustering analysis ( Fig 3B [href=#F3] , 3C [href=#F3] , Table S14 [href=this file] ).
GO analysis of genes distinguishing these two clusters pointed to processes such as immune cell differentiation, proliferation, migration and reactive inflammatory response pathways respectively ( Fig S2A [href=#SD3] , S2B [href=#SD3] and Table S15 [href=this file] , S16 [href=this file] ). This suggests the existence of a microglial signature - enriched for genes associated with inflammatory activation ( Fig S2C [href=#SD3] , Table S17 [href=this file] ) - that is present in non-lesional tissue specifically in MS-associated demyelination. By contrast, we observed a fourth microglial cluster, Micro_2_SOCS6_MYO1E, which showed enrichment only in the secondary demyelination group, again in all 3 brain regions ( Fig 3G [href=#F3] , Fig S2D [href=#SD3] , Table S18 [href=this file] ), suggesting that this signature may be a unique hallmark of demyelination accompanying diseases such as AD.",xlsx,Human disease-specific cell signatures in non-lesional tissue in Multiple Sclerosis detected by single-cell and spatial transcriptomics - PMC,HTML,"(12.1MB, xlsx)",media p,/articles/instance/10769298/bin/media-1.xlsx,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

First, while this threshold (cluster closeness score = 2.56) may permit false-positives if the simulated phosphosites only contain negatives, we observed many of the clusters containing activating or recurrent mutations with cluster closeness scores close to the threshold (Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). While hybrid clusters involving driver genes showed a higher density at the higher-score mode, driver gene status did not guarantee high scores (Supplementary Fig. 1B [this file] ). The 5% score threshold showed a sensitivity = 0.17 and specificity = 96.0% in distinguishing hybrid clusters with driver genes (Supplementary Fig. 1C [this file] ). Finally, we examined the score distribution using 200 bins on both the simulated vs. observed clusters, finding multiple peaks and alternative thresholds, for example, thresholding using one of the higher local minima retained only the top 2.28%, or the top 216 clusters (Supplementary Fig. 1D [this file] ). Cluster closeness scores for all identified clusters are provided herein to prioritize a more stringent set of clusters (Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). 
HotPho generated a final high-confidence set of 906 mutation-only, 127 phosphosite-only, and 474 hybrid clusters based on the top 5% cluster closeness score threshold (“Methods”, Supplementary Data 1 [this file] ). Phosphosite-only clusters are found in fewer instances: ANXA5, CLIP1, FLNB, GPI, HSPD1, PEBP1, and PTK2 each harbored two (Supplementary Fig. 2A [this file] ). 
The Ensembl transcripts used for mapping of the protein coordinates are described in Supplementary Data 1 [this file] . 
The top hybrid clusters of each protein—identified by the highest cluster closeness score—may span mutations and phosphosites that are far from one another in the linear distance (Fig. 2c [rid=Fig2] , Supplementary Fig. 2B [this file] ). The list of 48 mutations contained mutations of interest in PDE1B (5 mutations), SRSF7 (4 mutations), and PTPN12 p.S275F/C that co-localized with p.S275 and co-clustered with p.S39/p.T40 (Supplementary Data 2 [this file] ). 
Among the 1,255 co-clustered phosphosites, 291 sites directly overlap and 356 sites are proximal (within 2 amino acid residues linearly) to their co-clustered mutations (Supplementary Data 1 [this file] , Fig. 2b [rid=Fig2] ). 
We then examined whether proteins containing hybrid clusters are enriched in specific biological pathways curated by WikiPathways and the NCI-Nature Pathway Interaction Database using Enrichr (Supplementary Data 3 [this file] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] , “Methods”). 
Mapping residues to PFAM domains, we identified 26 PFAM domains significantly enriched for mutations and phosphosites in hybrid clusters when comparing to the background of all mapped mutations and phosphosites (Supplementary Data 4 [this file] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] , “Methods”). Another two top PFAM domains are protein tyrosine kinase and protein kinase domains (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). Notably, some kinase-domain clusters showed conserved mutation/phosphosite patterns across homologs, such as FGFR2 and FGFR3 (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] ). 
We found 29 hybrid clusters containing 90 of these activating mutations in 17 genes, suggesting the functional relevance of the 54 co-clustering phosphosites (Supplementary Data 5 [this file] ). 
We specifically examined these clusters on protein structures (Fig. 3b [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
We calculated the frequency of each of the co-clustering mutations within each of the TCGA cancer cohorts and identified their spatially adjacent phosphosites (Supplementary Data 6 [this file] ). We found that co-clustering phosphosites of the most recurrent mutations aggregate in proteins, including CTNNB1, HRAS, IDH1, KRAS, NRAS, PIK3CA, and TP53 (Fig. 3a [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] ). 
Using the TCGA Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) dataset for each of the 33 cancer types, we conducted a differential expression analysis to search for protein/phosphoprotein markers expressed at different levels in carriers of clustered mutations (“Methods”), identifying 24 significant (FDR < 0.05, linear regression) gene-cancer associations (Fig. 4b [rid=Fig4] , Supplementary Data 7 [this file] ). mutations in hybrid clusters are significantly correlated with higher p53 protein expression in 14 cancer types, most strikingly in UCEC, BRCA, COAD, and OV, consistent with the previously reported -effect of functional TP53 missense mutations . 
To further validate these findings, we conducted similar analyses of the mutational impact on protein expression using global proteomics datasets from retrospective and prospective CPTAC cohorts of breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers (2 cohorts/cancer) each comprised of 78–126 samples (“Methods”, Supplementary Data 8 [this file] , Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ). Other notable findings include that mutations in cluster 1357.1 are associated with high ESR1 in ovarian cancer, whereas mutations in cluster 756.0 (Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] ) are associated with high AKT1 proteins. 
By considering missense mutations (1) directly overlapping phosphosites, (2) proximal to phosphosites, and (3) co-clustering with phosphosites, we noticed that considering co-clustering mutations contribute significantly to the fraction of potentially functional mutations in many cancer genes including , , and (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] ). 
We then examined whether the co-clustered mutations show significant enrichment of activating mutations compared to the other mutations on a gene-by-gene basis (Fig. 5a, b [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Data 9 [this file] ). 
First, using a multivariate logistic regression model corrected for the mutated gene, we found that the number of co-clustering mutations was not significantly associated with the mutation functionality in either the BAF3 ( = 0.91) or MCF ( = 0.40) cell line (Supplementary Fig. 9A [this file] ). But, when adding the phosphosite co-clustering status to the regression model, the mutation functionality was no longer associated with recurrence ( > 0.21), but strongly associated with the co-clustering status in both BAF3 ( = 1.4e−10) and MCF10A ( = 1.5e−4) cell lines (Fig. 5c, d [rid=Fig5] , Supplementary Fig. 9A [this file] ). 
We also obtained similar results when comparing cell lines with co-clustered missense mutations versus other non-synonymous mutations (Supplementary Data 10 [this file] ). 
Of the 1255 co-clustered phosphosites, 259 were detected in at least one of the 5 cohorts (Fig. 6a [rid=Fig6] , Supplementary Data 11 [this file] ). 
Finally, we conducted a systematic literature review of co-clustering phosphosites regulated or implicated in cancer (“Methods”), finding 25 unique phosphosites across 18 proteins that were experimentally linked to cancer (Supplementary Data 12 [this file] ). 
Among the 1255 co-clustering phosphosites, only 25 were previously known to be associated with cancer (Supplementary Data 12 [this file] ). 
Currently, we only observed a handful of examples where a single tumor sample carries both of the co-clustering phosphosites and mutations in existing quantitative phosphoproteomics cohorts, precluding systematic investigations of their correlative relationships (Supplementary Fig. 9 [this file] ). 
To resolve the multi-modal distribution of cluster closeness scores, we further compared the score distributions for 299 mutation-enriched cancer driver genes versus other genes using a ROC curve analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1B, C [this file] ). 
We further evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves using different threshold of the Cc score (Supplementary Fig. 1D [this file] ).",pdf,Spatially interacting phosphorylation sites and mutations in cancer,XML,,,,,,,

The membrane was then placed in a 50-mL tube and incubated over night with the primary antibody (see Supplementary Tab. 3 [this file] ; dissolved in 5 % milk 0.05 % Tween TBS) at 4 °C on a roller bank. The following day, the membrane was washed three times 5 min in 0.05 % Tween TBS, after which it was incubated with the secondary antibody (see Supplementary Tab. 3 [this file] ), also diluted in 5 % milk 0.05 % Tween TBS (1 h, RT, on roller bank). 
The sequences were specific for 3R and 4R and are shown in Supplementary Tab. 4 [this file] . All primer sequences are shown in Supplementary Tab. 4 [this file] . 
The primary antibodies (see Supplementary Tab. 3 [this file] ) were diluted in 5% goat serum 0.1% Triton-X TBS, and the slices incubated overnight at 4°C in a humidified chamber. The following day, slices were washed in TBS three times, followed by incubation with the respective secondary antibodies (see Supplementary Tab. 3 [this file] ), which were diluted in 2% BSA TBS (1h, RT). 
Furthermore, mRNA analysis using NanoString technology and PCR corroborated the absence of murine tau expression in htau-KI mice (Fig. 1 [rid=Fig1] c, d) and 5xFADxhtau-KI crossbreds (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] b). 
Interestingly, for 3R/4R tau protein, a relative ratio of approx. 1 was observed in 7-month-old mice (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] d, Supplementary Fig. 2 [this file] a–d), resembling the human 3R/4R tau protein ratio. 
The comparison of WT, htau-KI, 5xFAD, and 5xFADxhtau-KI models revealed that a large fraction of variation in gene expression observed between WT and 5xFADxhtau-KI could be attributed to the 5xFAD model (Supplementary Fig. 1 [this file] , Supplementary Tab. 1 [this file] , 2 [this file] ). 
At 7 months, multiple pathways in the 5xFADxhtau-KI model showed a significant enrichment when compared to the 5xFAD model (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] a). Among these pathways, genes in the KEGG oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) pathway were coordinatively upregulated in the presence of htau-KI (5xFADxhtau-KI) when compared to the 5xFAD model (mmu190, enrichment score= 0.69, adjusted -value= 0.0058) (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] , Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] a). In contrast, genes in the oxphos pathway (hsa190, enrichment score= −0.59, adjusted -value= 0.0025) were downregulated in deceased AD patients from the MSBB cohort when compared to non-demented controls (Supplementary Fig. 3 [this file] b–d) (see also: https://agora.ampadportal.org/genes (https://agora.ampadportal.org/genes) for detailed human gene expression profiles). 
At 13 months of age, multiple pathways, which are linked to extracellular matrix and immune function, are downregulated in the 5xFADxhtau-KI model while the calcium and oxytocin signaling pathways are upregulated when compared to the 5xFAD model (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] a). The ECM-receptor interaction is upregulated (hsa04512, enrichment score= 0.67, FDR-adjusted -value= 0.0088) in the TCX brain region from the Mayo cohort associated with the TCXblue co-expression module (Fig. 3 [rid=Fig3] ) and downregulated in the 5xFADxhtau-KI model (mmu04512, enrichment score= −0.72, FDR-adjusted -value= 0.011) (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] a, b). Among the genes, which showed decreased expression in the 5xFADxhtau-KI model compared to the 5xFAD model, were multiple AD candidate genes (Supplementary Fig. 4 [this file] c), which are significantly upregulated in AD patients compared to controls. is an integrin that facilitates cell-extracellular matrix adhesion, which has been shown to act as a transcriptional hub gene for inflammatory AD modules [ 41 [rid=CR41] ]. has been highlighted as an important hub gene in an integrated proteomic and transcriptomic study in the ROS/MAP cohort [ 42 [rid=CR42] ]. 
Quantification of overall plaque deposition revealed no statistically significant differences in the total plaque area between 5xFAD and 5xFADxhtau-KI at 7 and 13 months of age (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] c, Supplementary Fig. 5 [this file] b-f). In addition, the inflammatory phenotype expected for 5xFAD mice could also be seen in 5xFADxhtau-KI crossbreds, but not in htau-KI, as studied by astroglial (GFAP, Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] a, c) and microglial (Iba-1, Supplementary Fig. 6 [this file] b, d) staining. 
Additionally, we analyzed the distance covered by an animal to reach the platform (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] a, b) and swim speed (Supplementary Fig. 7 [this file] c, d) as score for cognitive learning curves as they also reflect the actual spatial learning abilities.",pdf,A novel human tau knock-in mouse model reveals interaction of Abeta and human tau under progressing cerebral amyloidosis in 5xFAD mice,XML,,,,,,,

Correspondence to ground truth was highly dataset dependent: 3 datasets averaged ~ 10% difference between the methods, while on 4 datasets, SE2 correspondence by ARI was only ~ 50% of Seurat (Additional File 1 [this file] : Fig S7). If the study goal is to mirror the style of classes that have previously been found, then Seurat is a good choice; in contrast, if the application would benefit from discovery of more granular cellular classes, SE2 will more likely produce that type of result (see Supplement [this file] on multiscale results).

In KIRC, the key miRNA-target interactions, such as miR-29a: and miR-17: , are highly predictive of clinical outcome ( -value<0.05, Supplementary Figure 1C [href=this file] and Supplementary Figure 1D [href=this file] ).
While in KIRC, key targets of miRNAs in the low-risk group were mostly enriched in ‘cell death’, ‘cell proliferation’ and ‘vasculogenesis’, those in the high-risk group were mostly enriched in ‘cell adhesion’, ‘cell motion’ and ‘epithelial cell migration’ ( Supplementary Figure 2A [href=this file] ), which is consistent with that KIRC is a typical metabolic disease [ 32 [href=#R32] ].
Key targets of miR-204 in KIRC were specifically enriched in ‘apoptosis’ and ‘programmed cell death’ ( Supplementary Figure 2B [href=this file] ), consistent with inhibition of renal clear cell carcinoma tumor growth [ 38 [href=#R38] ].
Analogously, in KIRC, the top three hallmarks of cancer are ‘sustained angiogenesis’, ‘tissue invasion and metastasis’ and ‘insensitivity to antigrowth signal’ ( Supplementary Figure 2C [href=this file] ). It is of interest to note that a hallmark of metastasis ‘tissue invasion and metastasis’ is significantly influenced by prognosis-related key miRNA-target interactions in ten distinct types of cancer (Figure 3D [href=#F3] , Supplementary Figure 3 [href=this file] ).
It may suggest the important role of key miRNAs in cancer metastasis, since similar results were also observed in KIRC ( Supplementary Figure 2D [href=this file] ).
The results showed significant difference between two groups in terms of PFS ( -value=0.016, log-rank test, Supplementary Figure 4A [href=this file] ) and KPS ( -value=0.024, Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary Figure 4B [href=this file] ). The percentage of GBM patients with (M1) or without (M0) distant metastases showed extremely close to significance ( -value=0.077, Fisher’s exact test, Supplementary Figure 4C [href=this file] ).
Most cancer types (11 out of 16; 68.8%) showed that key miRNA-target interactions remained an independent prognostic signature for survival ( Supplementary Figure 4D [href=this file] ).
We found that in most TCGA cancer types (11 out of 16; 68.8%) key miRNA-target interactions did not provide prognostic value in more than one other cancer type ( Supplementary Figure 5 [href=this file] ).
Interestingly, we found that the combination of key miRNA-target interactions identified in malignant adenocarcinomas including LUAD, STAD and COAD could be an independent predictor for overall survival of another adenocarcinoma PAAD patients, individually ( Supplementary Figure 5 [href=this file] ).",pdf,Optimizing prognosis-related key miRNA-target interactions responsible for cancer metastasis - PMC,HTML,"(3.8MB, pdf)",media p,/articles/instance/5752539/bin/oncotarget-08-109522-s001.pdf,usa-link,click_feat_suppl,,

Consistent with previous reports that FVB mice can be more vulnerable to neurodegeneration, we observed that F1 Tau transgenics on the FVB/C57 (TPR50xFVB/NJ) background had decreased survival and increased pathological tau as compared to the C57/C57 (TPR50xC57BL/6J) and DBA/C57 (TPR50xDBA/2J) progeny ( Fig. 1b [rid=F1] ) ( Supplementary Fig. 1c [this file] – h [this file] ). Importantly, no significant decrease in the weight of any of the affected brain areas was detected in transgenic animals at six months ( Supplementary Fig. 1i [this file] ), consistent with previous data showing no cell loss at this stage . 
The differentially expressed genes from transgenic and wild type mice clearly separate tau mutant from wild type genotypes within affected brain regions ( Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] – c [this file] ), but not in the cerebellum ( Supplementary Fig. 2a [this file] ), and are consistent are across strains ( Supplementary Fig. 2d [this file] , e [this file] ). There was significant overlap in differential expression ( Online Methods [rid=S19] ; Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ) between the cortex and hippocampus, and significant correlation between fold changes in differentially expressed genes (Rank-rank hypergeometric test; p<0.05) from these two regions (R =0.76, slope=0.92, Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). We find lesser, but significant correlation in gene expression between the cortex and brain stem (R =0.33, slope=0.82, Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Consistent with the absence of significant cell loss at six months in this model , positive regulators of apoptosis (GO ID:0043065) do not show significant changes across all 3 strains ( Supplementary Fig. 3b [this file] – e [this file] ) and negative regulators of apoptosis (GO ID :0043066) show modest, more significant changes ( Supplementary Fig. 3f [this file] – i [this file] ).We note that although we do not observe frank apoptosis, we do see evidence for initial activation of cellular pathways associated with inflammation in cerebral cortex by six months, including increases in GFAP and Iba-1 immunoreactivity in cortex ( Fig. 1d [rid=F1] – f [rid=F1] ). 
We observed no significant overlap in gene expression between the cortex and cerebellum ( Supplementary Fig. 3j [this file] – k [this file] ) and no correlation between differentially expressed genes in cortex and cerebellum (R =0.01, slope=0.14, Supplementary Fig. 3a [this file] ). Even more striking is that the expression changes of the top upregulated genes in the cerebellum are reversed in the cortex ( Supplementary Fig. 3l [this file] ), implying that protective changes may potentially occur in the cerebellum, as has been previously suggested . 
To place gene expression changes in a systems level framework, we performed consensus Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (cWGCNA ) across all three heterozygous F1 mouse strains to identify relationships not observed in only a single background ( Supplementary Fig. 4a [this file] , Supplementary Table 1 [rid=SD3] ). Cell-type enrichment analysis demonstrated that the salmon module is enriched in neuronal markers, the magenta module for oligodendrocyte markers, and the turquoise module for microglial, astrocyte and endothelial markers ( Fig. 2b [rid=F2] ) across multiple different cell type specific gene expression datasets ( Supplementary Fig. 4b [this file] ). Gene ontology (GO) analyses is consistent with the cell type enrichments, showing that the salmon module is enriched for synaptic pathways, magenta for DNA repair and transcription, while the turquoise module is enriched for immune and inflammatory categories ( Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] – d [this file] ). 
Genes correlated highly with phospho-tau levels (R >0.6; Online Methods [rid=S19] ) were found to be significantly enriched in the salmon (42-fold) and turquoise modules (9.5-fold), but not in the magenta and pink modules ( Supplementary Fig. 4e [this file] ). Given the consistent cell type enrichments and strong gene ontology enrichments ( Fig. 2b [rid=F2] , d-g; and Supplementary Fig 4b [this file] – d [this file] ) we relabel the salmon module, the Neurodegeneration-Associated Synaptic (NAS) module, and the turquoise module, the Neurodegeneration-Associated Inflammatory (NAI) module, so as to provide more intuitive names for these core disease-associated modules. 
Moreover, both the NAI and NAS module eigengenes show changes across affected brain regions (cortex, Fig. 2e [rid=F2] , h [rid=F2] ; hippocampus, Supplementary Fig. 4f [this file] – g [this file] ; brain stem, Supplementary Fig. 4h [this file] – i [this file] ) but not cerebellum ( Fig. 2i [rid=F2] , j [rid=F2] ), prior to decreases in brain weight that would be indicative of cell loss ( Supplementary Fig. 1i [this file] ). This is further supported by analysis of expression profiles from sorted neurons and glia from the Tg4510 and PS2APP AD model which show cell intrinsic changes in the NAI and NAS module trajectories ( Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] – d [this file] ). The NAI module is highly preserved in both microglia and astrocytes and significantly upregulated in these populations in transgenics ( Supplementary Fig. 5a [this file] , c [this file] , d [this file] – l [this file] ), while the neuronal NAS module is highly preserved in sorted neurons and downregulated in transgenics ( Supplementary Fig. 5b [this file] , e [this file] – l [this file] ). 
Functional annotation of the NAS module with GO and KEGG terms, confirms its broader relationship to synaptic function ( Fig. 2d [rid=F2] and Supplementary Fig. 4c [this file] ). In contrast, functional annotation of the NAI module highlights pathways associated with astrogliosis and inflammatory changes , including T cell activation and Toll-like receptor signaling pathways ( Fig. 2g [rid=F2] and Supplementary Fig. 4d [this file] ). 
Further analysis of 4 independent datasets from mouse models harboring pathological tau mutations including a replication dataset that we generated using the Tg4510 tau model (Methods, Supplementary Fig 5f [this file] ) confirm the preservation of the NAI and NAS modules ( Supplementary Fig 5e [this file] ), and the expected changes in gene expression early in the disease course ( Supplementary Fig. 5f [this file] - h [this file] , l [this file] ). The NAS and NAI models are highly preserved and their disease associations are maintained and both the NAI and NAS module expression changes occur with similar temporal profiles across each of these models ( Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] , i [this file] – l [this file] ). 
The NAS and NAI modules are dysregulated in patient cortex, but not in cerebellum, both in the previously published microarray-based data and in our newly generated RNA-seq dataset ( Fig. 3a [rid=F3] – d [rid=F3] and Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] , m [this file] – n [this file] ) consisting of both tau-positive and tau-negative FTD ( Fig. 3c [rid=F3] ). Moreover, the NAS module and its disease-trait relationship are preserved in iPSC-derived neurons from human FTD patients carrying GRN mutations ( Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] , o [this file] ). 
We also performed mass-spectrometry-based, label-free, quantitative proteomics in an independent set of GRN-positive and GRN-negative FTD frontal cortex ( Supplementary Fig. 5p [this file] , Supplementary Table 2c [rid=SD4] – d [rid=SD4] , Online Methods [rid=S19] ). 
Examination of RNA sequencing and proteomic post mortem brain datasets from AD patients showed preservation of both the NAI and the NAS modules at the mRNA ( Supplementary Fig. 5e [this file] , Fig. 3g [rid=F3] – h [rid=F3] , Supplementary Table 4a [rid=SD6] ), and at the protein level ( Fig. 3i [rid=F3] ). 
We identified two miRNA modules associated with the transgenic condition (Bonferroni corrected P < 0.05, Fig. 4a [rid=F4] , Supplementary Table 3 [rid=SD5] ): the miM12 module that is anti-correlated, and the miM16 module ( Fig. 4b [rid=F4] ), which is positively correlated with the transgenic condition in affected regions, but not cerebellum ( Fig. 4c [rid=F4] and Supplementary Fig. 6a [this file] – e [this file] ). The miM16 module eigengene is strongly anti-correlated with the NAS module eigengene ( Fig. 4d [rid=F4] and Supplementary Fig. 6f [this file] ), and predicted targets of miR-203, an miM16 hub, are highly enriched (see Online Methods [rid=S19] ) in the NAS module ( Fig. 4e [rid=F4] and Supplementary Fig. 6g [this file] , h [this file] ). Consistent with its potential regulatory role, miR-203 is robustly upregulated in transgenic mice at six months in disease-affected areas ( Fig. 4f [rid=F4] and Supplementary Fig. 6i [this file] – k [this file] ), and in the frontal cortex in both tau-positive and tau-negative FTD ( Fig. 4g [rid=F4] , h [rid=F4] ). 
To test the predicted causal relationship between miR-203 expression and NAS module down-regulation, we acutely over-expressed miR-203 ( Fig. 5a [rid=F5] ) in primary cortical mouse neuronal cultures ( Online Methods [rid=S19] , Supplementary Fig. 7a [this file] ), observing downregulation of its predicted targets ( Fig. 5b [rid=F5] ) and the NAS module more broadly ( Fig. 5c [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 7b [this file] , Supplementary Table 4a [rid=SD6] ). We further experimentally validated several predicted direct targets of miR-203 ( , , , ) by luciferase reporter assays ( Fig. 5f [rid=F5] ) and western blot (BCL2L2 and VSNL1l; Fig. 5g [rid=F5] , see Supplementary Fig 9 [this file] for uncropped blots). 
To control for potential confounding by supra-physiological over-expression in vitro, we moderately overexpressed miR-203 (approximately 2-fold; Online Methods [rid=S19] ) or a scrambled miRNA control (sc-miRNA) ( Fig. 5h [rid=F5] ) targeting neurons in wild-type mice in vivo ( Supplementary Fig. 7c [this file] – f [this file] ). The NAS module is highly preserved ( Supplementary Fig. 7g [this file] , Supplementary Table 4a [rid=SD6] ) and down-regulated in neurons overexpressing miR-203 after six weeks ( Fig. 5i [rid=F5] ). Strikingly, the level of miR-203 expression correlates remarkably well with downregulation of both miR-203 predicted targets (R =0.81, slope=−2.3; Supplementary Fig. 7h [this file] ) and NAS module genes (R =0.81, slope=−2.2; Supplementary Fig. 7i [this file] ). Furthermore, apoptotic pathways are altered in miR-203-overexpressing neurons (, Figure 5j [rid=F5] , Supplementary Table 4b [rid=SD6] ), confirmed by Casp8 protein expression ( Figure 5k [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 7j [this file] ). Additionally, miR-203 over-expression in one-month-old Tg4510 Tau transgenic cortex ( Supplementary Fig. 8a [this file] – b [this file] ) causes downregulation of predicted miR-203 targets ( Fig. 5l [rid=F5] ), the NAS module ( Fig. 5m [rid=F5] ), a significant increase in CASP8 protein ( Fig. 5n [rid=F5] ) and apoptotic pathways ( Supplementary Fig. 8c [this file] – d [this file] ) and genes involved in calcium signaling and neuroactive ligand receptors ( Supplementary Fig. 8e [this file] – f [this file] ). 
Both short term (6-weeks, Supplementary Fig. 8g [this file] – h [this file] ) and longer term (4-months, Supplementary Fig. 8i [this file] – j [this file] ) inhibition of miR-203 oppose the pathologic transcriptional changes in predicted miR-203 targets ( Supplementary Fig. 8k [this file] , Fig. 5o [rid=F5] ) and the NAS module broadly ( Supplementary Fig. 8l [this file] , Fig. 5p [rid=F5] ) including genes involved in calcium signaling and neuroactive ligand receptor pathways ( Supplementary Fig. 8m [this file] – n [this file] ), and apoptosis ( Fig. 5q [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 8o [this file] – p [this file] ). Reducing miR-203 did not affect phospho-tau immunostaining ( Supplementary Fig. 8q [this file] – r [this file] ), consistent with its acting downstream of tau pathology. C-fos intensity was also significantly increased in mutant neurons expressing the miR-203 TuD construct, as compared to those expressing the control construct ( Fig. 5q [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 8s [this file] , p-value <0.0001), suggesting functional rescue. 
It is noteworthy that modules identified in the initial individual F1 crosses that are not conserved and dysregulated across all three strains, are also not conserved in other mouse models, or human brain ( Supplementary Fig 10a [this file] – c [this file] ), supporting the approach that we have taken. 
As we show, long-term inhibition of miR-203 in the Tg4510 model, while upregulating anti-apoptotic pathways, downregulating pro-apoptotic pathways and increasing neuronal activity as measured by c-fos activation, does not reduce the phospho-tau burden ( Supplementary Fig. 8q [this file] – r [this file] ).

To test the predicted causal relationship between miR-203 expression and NAS module down-regulation, we acutely over-expressed miR-203 ( Fig. 5a [rid=F5] ) in primary cortical mouse neuronal cultures ( Online Methods [rid=S19] , Supplementary Fig. 7a [rid=SD2] ), observing downregulation of its predicted targets ( Fig. 5b [rid=F5] ) and the NAS module more broadly ( Fig. 5c [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 7b [rid=SD2] , Supplementary Table 4a [this file] ). 
The NAS module is highly preserved ( Supplementary Fig. 7g [rid=SD2] , Supplementary Table 4a [this file] ) and down-regulated in neurons overexpressing miR-203 after six weeks ( Fig. 5i [rid=F5] ). Furthermore, apoptotic pathways are altered in miR-203-overexpressing neurons (, Figure 5j [rid=F5] , Supplementary Table 4b [this file] ), confirmed by Casp8 protein expression ( Figure 5k [rid=F5] , Supplementary Fig. 7j [rid=SD2] ). 
Four of the top 10 hits were histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACs, Supplementary Table 4c [this file] ), which was significant (permutated p< 10 ).

The resultant reads were uniformly processed using a common workflow (see “ Methods [rid=Sec13] ”) and mapped to the human genome (version GRCh37d5) (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. 
For example, none of the putative SNV calls were identified by each of the six working groups and only three calls were identified by five of six groups (Fig. 2 [rid=Fig2] b and Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S1). 
We subjected 400 putative mosaic SNVs to validation experiments (Tables S 1 [this file] & S 2 [rid=MOESM2] ). 
Finally, to verify the validation status, we performed droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) experiments for thirteen calls (Additional file 1 [this file] : Table S3). 
Moreover, consistent with previous data [ 17 [rid=CR17] ], the SNV mutation spectrum was dominated by C>T transitions (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. 
Finally, 14/29 putative mosaic SNVs were located within regions of the genome containing germline copy number gains, leading to < 0.5 VAFs (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. 
By comparison, bona fide validated mosaic SNVs were detected as alternative reads on a single haplotype, giving the appearance of three haplotype states (i.e., the two parental haplotypes plus a “third” haplotype containing the somatic SNV on a single parental haplotype; Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. 
A systematic misalignment of these germline variants (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. S7) and/or a systematic reduction in read counts near the germline variant (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. 
We found the input “discovery” call set has a significant impact on final sensitivity and determined that a GATK ploidy option of 50 for the 250× coverage WGS replicate 6 dataset, which corresponds to approximately five sequencing reads per haplotype, generally allowed the best approach to identify validated mosaic SNVs (Fig. 4 [rid=Fig4] d and Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. For our best practices framework, we incorporated MosaicForecast as an additional step to obtain the highest accuracy call sets (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig.

The eight best scoring SNV pairs consisted of a SNV (SNVs 1–4) from the L1 lineage and a SNV from L2 lineage (SNV10 and SNV11; Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig. Using a similar strategy, we also were able to identify anti-correlated mosaic SNV VAFs that defined L1 and L2 sub-lineages that likely arose later in development (Additional file 1 [this file] : Fig.
