The descriptive study consisted of surveys, health screenings, and needs assessment surveys that were administered in Korean (n=284) and South Asian (n=305) communities at community health fairs in order to characterize community members' general health needs, access to services, lifestyle behaviors, and perceptions of disease as related to diabetes prevention and health promotion. Focus groups were also lead by CHWs and conducted with Korean and South Asian immigrant communities. The CHW intervention utilized a randomized controlled design. The eligible participants were Korean and South Asian immigrants between 18 and 75 years of age, identified as at risk for diabetes by a risk assessment, and willing to be randomizing into a treatment or control group. The pilot intervention was completed in 2012 and included a total of 145 Asian Indian and 48 Korean individuals.

After completing their training cycles, larvae were placed in a Y-maze with one corridor that contained CO2 while the other contained air. Navigating to the corridor with CO2 was scored as \"Approach\" and navigating to the corridor with air only was scored as \"Avoid\". Learning was evaluated through video recordings of multiple trials conducted over the course of an hour. A subset of larvae were also tested on the following day to evaluate long-term retention.

This study contains electrophysiology, imaging, and behavioral data. Electrophysiological recordings identified CX cell types in\u00a0Drosophila\u00a0and presented directional visual, olfactory, and airflow cues known to elicit orienting behavior. They found that a group of neurons targeting the ventral fan-shaped body (ventral P-FNs) are robustly tuned for airflow direction.

Questions asked in the CHRNAs assess various determinants of health, including  length of residence in the United States, English language proficiency, educational attainment, employment and income, perceived health, health insurance and access to care, nutrition and physical activity, mental health, screening for cancer and other chronic diseases, sleep deprivation, and connections to social and religious environments.<\/p> \r\n<p>The second round of CHRNAs, conducted in 2013-2016, examined population changes, population health improvements, and changes in risk and protective factors in the last decade. Approximately 100 individuals were surveyed from each of the following Asian subgroups: Arab, Asian Indian, Bangladeshi, Cambodian, Chinese, Filipino, Himalayan, Indo-Caribbean, Japanese, Korean, Pakistani, Ski Lankan, and Vietnamese (n=1,803).<\/p>","access_instructions":"Please complete the Data Request Form to request access to this dataset.

Its main role is to stabilize microtubules, supporting cytoskeletal organization, and axonal transport. Tau may undergo pathological modifications and become hyperphosphorylated. This causes the protein to accumulate into toxic assemblies that collectively lead to neurodegeneration. In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins change shape and organize themselves into structures called neurofibrillary tangles. The tangles disrupt the transport system and are toxic to cells.

Autoimmunity during Trypanosoma brucei infection is indicated to have a role during anemia, but anemia caused by trypanosome infection is poorly understood. In mouse models and human patients infected with malaria parasites, atypical B-cells promote anemia through the secretion of autoimmune anti-phosphatidylserine (anti-PS) antibodies that bind to uninfected erythrocytes and facilitate their clearance.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This study used mouse models of two trypanosome infections, Trypanosoma brucei and Trypanosoma cruzi, to assess levels of autoantibodies and anemia. PS exposure on erythrocyte plasma membrane appears to contribute to anemia by delaying erythrocyte recovery. As a result, this study also examined plasma of patients with human African trypanosomiasis. The dataset includes three tables, which contains optical density values for antibodies and anemia during acute Trypanosoma brucei infection in mice, antibodies and anemia during acute Trypanosoma cruzi infection in mice, and human African Trypanosomiasis and anti-PS antibody response.<\/p>","access_instructions":"All relevant data are within the article and its Supplementary Materials.","pubmed_search":null,"dataset_size":null,"subject_start_date":"2002","subject_end_date":"2003","library_catalog_url":null,"licensing_details":null,"license_expiration_date":null,"subscriber":null,"data_locations":[{"data_location":"PMC","location_content":null,"data_access_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/labs\/pmc\/articles\/PMC8505006\/","accession_number":null}],"dataset_alternate_titles":[],"other_resources":[],"related_datasets":[],"authorships":[{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":1,"person":"Juan Rivera-Correa"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":2,"person":"Joseph Verdi"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":3,"person":"Julian Sherman"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":4,"person":"Jeremy M.

The study has 22 years of clinical data on more than 1,100 people and brain tissue from\u00a0over 350 people. Gene expression profiles of CA1 pyramidal neurons and the surrounding hippocampal formation were examined using custom-designed microarray and qPCR analysis applied to postmortem human brain tissue. This dataset contains microarray data, which indicate a significant downregulation of several neurotrophin genes in CA1 pyramidal neurons.<\/p>","access_instructions":"Please complete the Data Request Form to request access to this dataset.

Studies have shown that brain metastases depend on cooperative cellular interactions between tumor cells and specialized cells within the central nervous system (CNS). Metabolic constraints imposed by the serine and glycine limited brain environment restrict metastatic tumor growth. This study showed that 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), which catalyzes the rate limiting step of glucose derived serine synthesis, is a major determinant of brain metastasis. The dataset contains proteomic, metabolomic, and immunohistochemistry data. The data revealed that extracellular amino acid availability determines serine synthesis pathway dependence, which suggests that PHGDH inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of brain metastasis.<\/p>","access_instructions":"Please complete the Data Request Form to request access to this dataset.

Recently, a subset of exosomes was labeled as defensosomes that are assembled during bacterial infection. Defensosomes mediate host defense by binding and inhibiting pore-forming toxins secreted by bacterial pathogens through incorporating protein receptors on their surface. Therefore, this study examined the role of defensosomes during infection by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the etiological agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). It was found that ACE2+ exosomes were induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are defined as defensosomes. This study showed that ACE2+ defensosomes directly bind and block viral entry.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>This dataset includes raw sequencing data, as well as supplementary data tied to the publication. The supplementary data contains data about characteristics of exosomes from COVID-19 patient bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, characterizing role of exosomes against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, cryo-EM tomogram and 3D rendering of an exosome and SARS-CoV-2 virion, low expression of the short ACE2 isoform dACE2 detected in a subset of COVID patients, correlation of dACE2 expression in COVID patients with various interferon stimulated genes, full-length ACE2 and not dACE2 is loaded onto exosomes, heatmap of IPA analysis including comparisons between \u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d groups for percent ACE2+ exosomes and ACE2 mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value, and signaling pathway analysis of differentially expressed genes in the \u201chigh\u201d percent ACE2+ exosome group and differentially expressed genes in the \u201chigh\u201d ACE2 MFI exosome group.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>The supplementary data also contains video about tomograms from Cryo-ET of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2+ exosomes, low expression of the short ACE2 isoform dACE2 detected in a subset of COVID patients, and tomographic reconstructions of exosomes and virions. The data even includes raw western blot images and tables that contain data about demographics and clinical characteristics of the COVID-19 patient cohort, regression using negative binomial model and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) as the outcome, linear regression on covariates including ACE2 MFI using length of stay in the ICU as the outcome and ACE2 MFI using ventilation days as an outcome, and regression using negative binomial model and ventilation days as the outcome.

Study participants included a representative survey sample of US women aged 18 to 45 years old who had participated in a related study about perceptions of the Zika virus (n=75) as well as women recruited from a national sampling frame coordinated by Qualtrics Panels (n=165). Wave 1 was conducted between July  25, 2016 and August 18, 2016; wave 2 was conducted between December 9, 2016 and December 31, 2016; and wave 3 was conducted between December 9, 2017 and December 22, 2017. Demographic information collected in the survey included age, race, highest level of education, household income, and political affiliation. The survey also polled respondents on their support of government measures to control the vector population (mosquitoes), personal preventive practices, knowledge of the Zika virus and transmission, perception of risk, and decision-making.","access_instructions":"Public-use data are available for download from the ICPSR repository along with relevant documentation.

in adult murine hearts. This study combined pre-embedding immunolabeling with serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) to visualize and examine the gap junction plaque morphology. They used a murine model of cardiomyocyte-specific Tamoxifen (TAM) activated knockout of PKP2. For this study, adult murine hearts were harvested 14 days post-TAM, and thick vibratome slices were immunolabelled for Cx43 and treated with nanogold. Left or right ventricular free walls were dissected and three-dimensional localization of Cx43 in cardiac muscle was performed using SBF-SEM.

To determine the molecular mechanism, RNA sequencing analysis was used to examine changes in the transcriptome in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVECs). Validated small interfering RNA was used to knockdown NGBR in HBMVECs. Then, isolated RNA was used to examine the alteration of transcriptomic profiling using RNA sequencing.

Schools were eligible for enrollment if the student population consisted of at least 50% Black and\/or Hispanic\/Latino and 80% receiving free or reduced price lunch. Subjects within schools were excluded if they did not speak English or were enrolled in special education classes. Patients were randomized to receive a biannual treatment consisting of either silver diamine fluoride or glass ionomer sealants\/atraumatic restorations.

Clinical data is stored in a secure REDCap database which contains 653 fields to capture clinical and pathological information. The database can be queried for research studies; customized datasets for statistical analyses are created in SAS\u00ae. Follow-up data is collected every 3, 6, or 12 months depending on the patient's clinical stage. Biospecimens (i.e., blood\/buffy coat, sera, plasma, lymphocytes; and blocks of primary, metastatic, and fresh melanoma tissues) are securely cataloged in LabVantage with linkage to corresponding clinical and pathological data contained in REDCap. Integration of high-quality, annotated biospecimens with clinicopathological data allow applications such as the examination of RNA expression (fresh tissue), protein expression (paraffin embedded tissue), and germline DNA sequences (blood) from the same patients.<\/p>\r\n<p>As of March 2023, 5,790 consenting patients (including 399 high-risk patients) have contributed clinical data and 99,039 biospecimens to the project. 2,977(55%) of patients are male; the mean age at diagnosis was 60 years old with a mean follow-up duration of 55 months.

In addition, peripheral oxytocin is important for milk ejection during nursing and uterine contractions during labor. Oxytocin is produced mainly in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This study describes a neural circuit routing auditory information about infant vocalizations to mouse oxytocin neurons. They performed in vivo electrophysiological recordings and photometry from identified oxytocin neurons in awake maternal mice presented with pup calls. For this study, they made cell-attached and whole-cell recordings from PVN oxytocin neurons and other optically-unresponsive PVN neurons in awake head-fixed mouse dams. The dataset contains electrophysiology, behavioral, histology, and fiber photometry data.

All-purpose Prediction Engines","origin":"Internal","restricted":false,"description":"<p>NYUTron is a large language model-based system that was developed with the objective of integrating clinical workflows centered around structured and unstructured notes and placing electronic orders in real time. The development team queried electronic health records from all NYU Langone facilities to generate two types of datasets: pre-training datasets (\"NYU Notes\", \"NYU Notes\u2013Manhattan\", \"NYU Notes\u2013Brooklyn\") which contain a total of 10 years of unlabelled inpatient clinical notes (387,144 patients, 4.1 billion words) and five fine-tuning datasets (\"NYU Readmission\", \"NYU Readmission\u2013Manhattan\", \"NYU Readmission\u2013Brooklyn\", \"NYU Mortality\", \"NYU Binned LOS\", \"NYU Insurance Denial\", \"NYU Binned Comorbidity\"), each containing 1 to 10 years of inpatient clinical notes (55,791 to 413,845 patients, 51 to 87 million words) with task-specific labels (2 to 4 classes). In addition, the team utilized two publicly available datasets, i2b2-2012 and MIMIC-III, for testing and fine-tuning. <\/p>\r\n<p>To assess the model's predictive capabilities, NYUTron was applied to a battery of five tasks: three clinical and two operational tasks (30-day all-cause readmission prediction, in-hospital mortality prediction, comorbidity index prediction, length of stay (LOS) prediction and insurance denial prediction).

They examined mice in which core subunit-encoding genes were selectively removed from motor neuron progenitors to determine the relative contributions of PRC1 and PRC2 to neuronal specification.

Office Measurements of Movements in the Extremities","origin":"External","restricted":false,"description":"<p>To test a low-cost system for obtaining continuous quantitative measurements of movements of people with Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), investigators attached accelerometers to the upper and lower extremities of twenty patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, one patient with multiple system atrophy (MSA) (participant 4), and eight age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) who performed twelve tasks modified from the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). Study participants were connected to four accelerometers and underwent twelve videotaped procedures. Videotapes were rated live by a trained examiner and scored according to the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). At least one week after the initial test, ten patients with Parkinson's disease and eight healthy controls underwent a retest. The patient with MSA completed only a test session. Participant 14 completed two re-tests due to an incomplete initial test: the first retest served as the test session and second retest served as the retest. Participant 16 did not complete any testing. The dataset includes the following for each participant: age and health status, the coding form with MDS-UPDRS scores, raw files, converted spreadsheets, and the fast Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms.<\/p>\r\n<p>Data analysis has focused the five repetitive tasks (finger tapping, hand movements, pronation-supination movements of the hands, toe tapping, and leg agility). This data was also utilized for a deep learning application (image classification) using GoogLeNet in MATLAB with the Deep Learning Toolbox. The images of fast Fourier transforms and continuous wavelet transforms were divided into two classes: low (corresponding to MDS-UPDRS scores of 0 and 1) and high (corresponding to scores of 3 and 4). An equal number of images was selected randomly from each category for classification and split 80-20 into training and testing sets. To reduce overfitting, the investigators incorporated a dropout layer. The network was trained with stochastic gradient descent with momentum optimizer and executed in a CPU environment. The network\u2019s ability to correctly classify the test images was used to determine an accuracy score.<\/p>","access_instructions":"Data and code can be accessed through the Mendeley Data repository.

All patients had coronary artery disease and three or more cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g., hypertension). Fresh carotid plaque specimens were obtained from 10 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy enrolled in a separate study (Athero-IN). These plaques were classified by a clinical cardiovascular pathologist (fibrocalcific, fibroatheroma, or unclassifiable) and processed for single cell RNA sequencing. To produce macrophages, human primary monocytes were exposed to human macrophage-colony stimulating factor in culture media; the macrophages and foam cells extracted from human aortic smooth muscle were then infected in-vitro with SARS-CoV-2 virus to examine differential interferon response and virus clearance dynamics as well as quantify the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Ex-vivo SARS-CoV-2 infection of human vascular explants was performed for bulk RNA sequencing and NRP-1 blocking experiments.

A secondary aim is to understand whether risk factors for new disease differ from those for OA progression. Data collection encompassed the following investigative themes: mechanical risk factors, causes of knee symptoms and pain, and the long-term disease trajectory of knee OA.<\/p>\r\n<p>The study enrolled 3,026 participants aged 50 to 79 years old with preexisting OA or at a high risk based on weight, knee symptoms, or a history of knee injuries or operations. Participants were recruited through community outreach campaigns in Birmingham, Alabama and Iowa City, Iowa. Approximately 15% of this cohort are African American and 60% are women. Baseline examinations began in 2003 and follow-up visits occurred at 15, 30, 60, 72, and 84 months. Each follow-up visit, with the exception of the 72-month visit, included clinical assessments and the collection of radiological data (i.e., x-ray and MRI), as well as other measures and instruments. The 72-month follow-up visit was conducted solely through telephone interviews. Biospecimens (i.e., blood and urine) were collected at baseline, 30 months, and 60 months. In 2016-2018, an additional 1,500 \"New Cohort\" participants with early or mild knee symptoms and x-ray findings of OA were enrolled in the study. The \u201cNew Cohort\u201d and surviving participants without end-stage knee osteoarthritis from the \u201cOriginal Cohort\u201d completed clinic visits and telephone follow-up contacts at 144- ,152- 160- and 168-months. In 2023, MOST was awarded grant funding to continue long term follow-up.<\/p>","access_instructions":"Public use data from MOST can be requested through the NIA Aging Research Biobank.

Recordings were made in a male mouse as it socially interacted with a female or male mouse in a chamber. The targeted SBN includes 5 hypothalamic regions, 5 amygdala regions, and 3 other regions outside of amygdala and hypothalamus. This dataset includes MFP recording and behavior annotation data, which provides a strategy to examine neural dynamics underlying social behaviors.<\/p>","access_instructions":"The data used in this study are publicly available on Zenodo and the custom software written in Python or MATLAB are also publicly available on GitHub.","pubmed_search":null,"dataset_size":null,"subject_start_date":null,"subject_end_date":null,"library_catalog_url":null,"licensing_details":null,"license_expiration_date":null,"subscriber":null,"data_locations":[{"data_location":"Zenodo","location_content":"Study data","data_access_url":"https:\/\/zenodo.org\/records\/8128564","accession_number":"8128564"},{"data_location":"GitHub","location_content":"Custom software","data_access_url":"https:\/\/github.com\/YiboChen2020\/MFPBehavioralAnalysis","accession_number":null}],"dataset_alternate_titles":[],"other_resources":[],"related_datasets":[],"authorships":[{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":1,"person":"Yibo Chen"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":2,"person":"Jonathan Chien"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":3,"person":"Bing Dai"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":true,"display_order":4,"person":"Dayu Lin"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":true,"display_order":5,"person":"Zhe Sage Chen"}],"subject_keywords":[{"keyword":"Aggression","mesh_code":"D000374"},{"keyword":"Animal Behavior","mesh_code":"D001522"},{"keyword":"Animal Model","mesh_code":"D023421"},{"keyword":"Animals","mesh_code":"D000818"},{"keyword":"Behavior","mesh_code":"D001519"},{"keyword":"Brain","mesh_code":"D001921"},{"keyword":"Calcium","mesh_code":"D002118"},{"keyword":"Hypothalamus","mesh_code":"D007031"},{"keyword":"Midbrain","mesh_code":"D008636"},{"keyword":"Neurons","mesh_code":"D009474"},{"keyword":"Neurosciences","mesh_code":"D009488"},{"keyword":"Photometry","mesh_code":"D010783"},{"keyword":"Social Behavior","mesh_code":"D012919"}],"publishers":[],"publications":[{"citation":"Chen Y, Chien J, Dai B, Lin D, Chen ZS.

Samples were obtained at multiple time points. Patients with an active infection contributed longitudinal samples up to 28 days post-onset of symptoms. To assess the vaccine response in healthy patients, samples were collected at baseline and at approximately 1, 3, and 4 weeks after the first vaccine dose. Three of the vaccine recipients also provided samples 5 weeks post-vaccine, pre-booster, and 1 and 4 weeks post-booster. In total, 42 post-vaccination and 9 post-infection samples were collected.

raters who were certified in the administration of the Movement Disorders Society-sponsored revision of the Unified Parkinson\u2019s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS). The objective was to determine the feasibility of a procedure for conducting sequential online motor assessments for one patient with Parkinson's disease. Each session followed the same protocol led by the principal investigator. To start, the patient was asked for permission to record the session and for information about current medications and weight. Then the investigator announced each motor assessment with the number and name of the task before conducting the task for all of the remote raters. The investigator provided specific instructions for each task and a demonstration before the participant was asked to begin the task. For the repetitive tasks, the participant was asked to perform the activities as fully and quickly as possible. Raters were asked to independently score each item immediately after it was performed without consultation with others. The raters were given one minute to determine their scores. This process was repeated for all of the tasks and scoring areas: observation of rest tremor amplitude upper limbs, observation of rest tremor amplitude upper limbs counting, observation of postural tremor of the hands, finger tapping, hand movements, pronation-supination movements of hands, and arising from the chair with the upper limbs. At the conclusion of each session, raters shared their scores with the investigator by email. After all sessions were completed, the investigator conducted a conference to attain agreement by consensus on a score for each task. An examiner certified in the MDS-UPDRS also calculated the percentage agreement for each of the tasks.","access_instructions":"Videos and rater scores can be accessed via the Mendeley Data repository.","pubmed_search":null,"dataset_size":null,"subject_start_date":null,"subject_end_date":null,"library_catalog_url":null,"licensing_details":null,"license_expiration_date":null,"subscriber":null,"data_locations":[{"data_location":"Mendeley Data","location_content":"All data and scores","data_access_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17632\/kd5gtfjdwr.2","accession_number":null},{"data_location":"Mendeley Data","location_content":"Data and scores from 8 sessions","data_access_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17632\/88rkr6rm5p.1","accession_number":null},{"data_location":"Mendeley Data","location_content":"Data and scores from 10 sessions","data_access_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17632\/2wf998hxfv.1","accession_number":null},{"data_location":"Mendeley Data","location_content":"Data and scores from 12 sessions","data_access_url":"https:\/\/doi.org\/10.17632\/7wynp4yxkh.1","accession_number":null}],"dataset_alternate_titles":[],"other_resources":[],"related_datasets":[],"authorships":[{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":1,"person":"Abdelwahab Elshourbagy"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":2,"person":"Samah Mostafa"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":3,"person":"Sudqi Allouzi"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":4,"person":"Abdelrahman Mohamed"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":5,"person":"Menna-Allah Hassan"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":6,"person":"Hasna Loulida"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":7,"person":"Menna Eltaras"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":8,"person":"Hassan Abdelshafy"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":9,"person":"Ahmed Sadaney"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":10,"person":"Samrah Javed"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":11,"person":"Vignesh Vanchinathan"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":12,"person":"Emilia Valik"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":13,"person":"Ramya Palani"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":14,"person":"Jaya Hamkins"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":15,"person":"Reem Belal"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":16,"person":"Isaac Chiu"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":17,"person":"Matthew Farah"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":18,"person":"Mohab Abdelhalim"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":19,"person":"Gabriela Mora"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":20,"person":"Nana Osei-Owusu"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":true,"display_order":21,"person":"James Robert Brasic"}],"subject_keywords":[{"keyword":"Biomechanics","mesh_code":"D001696"},{"keyword":"Chronic Disease","mesh_code":"D002908"},{"keyword":"Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures","mesh_code":"D019937"},{"keyword":"Disease Progression","mesh_code":"D018450"},{"keyword":"Hand","mesh_code":"D006225"},{"keyword":"Motor Activity","mesh_code":"D009043"},{"keyword":"Motor Skills","mesh_code":"D009048"},{"keyword":"Movement Disorders","mesh_code":"D009069"},{"keyword":"Neurodegenerative Disorders","mesh_code":"D019636"},{"keyword":"Neurosciences","mesh_code":"D009488"},{"keyword":"Parkinson's Disease","mesh_code":"D010300"},{"keyword":"Parkinsonian Disorders","mesh_code":"D020734"},{"keyword":"Primary Dysautonomias","mesh_code":"D054969"},{"keyword":"Tremor","mesh_code":"D014202"},{"keyword":"Upper Extremity","mesh_code":"D034941"}],"publishers":[],"publications":[{"citation":"Elshourbagy A, Eltaras MM, Abdalshafy H, Javed S, Sadaney AO, Harrigan TP, Mills KA, Hernandez ME, Bra\u0161i\u0107 JR.

The methodology partitions whole slide images (WSIs) into meaningful Histomorphological Phenotype Clusters (HPCs) that can be used to define and quantify morphological phenotypes which recur within and between cases. HPL employs the following approach: (1) WSI pre-processing, (2) self-supervised learning of tissue tiles, (3) tissue tile representation clustering into Histomorphological Phenotype Clusters (HPCs), and (4) HPC characterization. This process has been applied to images from 276 patients at NYU Langone and a multi-cancer cohort of patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify and study histomorphological phenotypes associated with lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). HPL was able to identify LUAD types and growth patterns that are comparable to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification, correlate with patient survival (mean concordance-index for recurrence-free survival= 0.74), and align with transcriptomic measures of immunophenotype.","access_instructions":"Source data for manuscript figures are included with the publication in Nature Communications.

RAS-related GTPase RIT1 proteins promote mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) hyperactivation, but this mechanism remains poorly understood. This study examined whether MEK1\/2 inhibition attenuates MAPK signaling in RIT1 M90I mice and ameliorates cardiac tissue overgrowth. They treated a cohort of 4-week-old mice harboring a germline Rit1M90I variant with the allosteric MEK1\/2 inhibitor trametinib.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, they isolated neonatal cardiomyocytes from mice harboring an engineered Rit1 locus with Cre recombinase-inducible expression of the pathogenic variant Rit1M90I to investigate the impact of mutant RIT1 expression in cardiac cells. Upon isolation, cardiomyocytes were treated with adenoviruses encoding for Cre recombinase to induce expression of the Rit1M90I variant. The dataset contains comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA sequencing data for heart tissue isolated from Rit1 M90I\/+ mice treated with Trametinib (1mg\/kg) or vehicle control for 20 weeks starting at 4 weeks of age, and comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA sequencing data for primary cardiomyocytes expressing WT RIT1 or RIT1 (M90I).<\/p>","access_instructions":"RNA sequencing data from this publication have been deposited in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).","pubmed_search":null,"dataset_size":null,"subject_start_date":null,"subject_end_date":null,"library_catalog_url":null,"licensing_details":null,"license_expiration_date":null,"subscriber":null,"data_locations":[{"data_location":"GEO","location_content":"RNA-seq data","data_access_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/query\/acc.cgi?acc=GSE207187","accession_number":"GSE207187"},{"data_location":"GEO","location_content":"RNA-seq data","data_access_url":"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/geo\/query\/acc.cgi?acc=GSE207188","accession_number":"GSE207188"}],"dataset_alternate_titles":[],"other_resources":[],"related_datasets":[],"authorships":[{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":1,"person":"Antonio Cuevas-Navarro"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":2,"person":"Morgan Wagner"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":3,"person":"Richard Van"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":4,"person":"Monalisa Swain"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":5,"person":"Stephanie Mo"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":6,"person":"John Columbus"},{"role":"Author","is_corresponding_author":false,"display_order":7,"person":"Madeline R.

Using the DNA\u2013RNA and RNA\u2013protein correlations, they inferred the degree of regulation at the RNA and protein levels. By revealing how cells regulate RNA and protein abundances of genes with SCNAs, they provided insights into the rules of gene regulation.

Differentiation of photoreceptors R1\u2013R7 requires epidermal growth factor (EGFR) signaling. The intrinsic zinc finger transcription factor Gl is expressed in all eye disc cells beginning just prior to their differentiation. In gl mutants, fewer cells in each ommatidial cluster express the neuronal marker Elav, suggesting that Gl contributes to neuronal fate specification. To understand which photoreceptor subtypes are affected by the loss of gl function, they performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis of gl<sup>60j<\/sup> mutant in Drosophila melanogaster on white prepupal eye discs.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>RNA sequencing was carried out on wandering third instar larval wing discs that contained clones expressing GFP; GFP and Gl; GFP and RasV12; GFP, Gl and RasV12; GFP, Gl and RasV12 in pntdelta88 mutant clones; and GFP and Gl in cicQ219X mutant clones. The goal was to discover genes that are synergistically activated by Gl and EGFR signaling. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis was performed on temperature sensitive mutant egfrtsla\/egfrf2 wandering third instar larval eye discs, where control samples were kept at 18<sup>\u00b0<\/sup>C and mutant samples were shifted to 29<sup>\u00b0<\/sup>C for 24 hours. The DNA adenine methyltransferase identification (DamID) experiment was performed on wandering third instar larval eye discs for two transcription factors, Gl and Pnt, as well as Dam-only controls. The GAL4 drivers used were atonal-GAL4, expressed in the morphogenetic furrow, and elav-GAL4, expressed in the committed photoreceptors.<\/p>","access_instructions":"All the raw data for single cell RNA sequencing, bulk RNA sequencing, and DamID sequencing have been archived on Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).

Multiple studies have provided evidence that it may improve motor learning, cognitive, and emotional processes in normal and brain-injured individuals. This study examined how AC stimulation applied to the external skull surface overlying crus 1 altered Purkinje cell (PC) and cerebellar nuclear (CN) cell activity in anesthetized adult female Sprague Dawley rats to approximate more closely the ctACS conditions. The dataset contains electrophysiology data from experiments where they applied AC stimulation at frequencies ranging from 0.5 to 80 Hz, to the skull surface above crus 1, and recorded single unit spiking from a total of 64 cells: non-identified cortical cells (n\u2009=\u200915), PCs (n\u2009=\u200916) and CN cells (n\u2009=\u200933; lateral CN: n\u2009=\u200927; anterior interpositus: n\u2009=\u20093, posterior interpositus: n\u2009=\u20093). Recordings at each AC frequency consisted of approximately ten 10-s long periods of AC stimulation interleaved with 10-s nonstimulation periods during which spontaneous activity was recorded, for a total recording period of\u2009~\u20093-min at each stimulus frequency.<\/p>","access_instructions":"Please complete the Data Request Form to request access to this dataset.

Data from NEMSIS are also used to help benchmark performance, determine the effectiveness of clinical interventions, and facilitate cost-benefit analyses.

That is, a single patient may be represented in more than one record for a variety of reasons. A patient may request EMS assistance frequently, and therefore, be represented in the dataset more than once. In addition, several agencies may respond to the same event (i.e., one patient) and each submit a patient care record to the National EMS Database. Thus, the dataset is referred to as a registry of \u201cEMS activations.\u201d <\/p>\r\n<p>The dataset does not contain information that identifies patients, EMS agencies, receiving hospitals, or reporting states.

utilizes a family of pore-forming toxins, leukocidins, to evade the host immune response and promote infection. Among these is leukocidin AB (LukAB), which engages host receptors to initiate pore formation on the host cell. The established cellular receptor for LukAB is CD11b. This study intoxicated CD11b-deficient cells with an alanine scanning library of CC8 LukAB to identify mutations that enable LukAB to exhibit full cytotoxicity in the absence of CD11b to understand the role of CD11b in the LukAB pore-forming process. 30 mutations primarily localized in the stem domains of LukA and LukB were found that enabled LukAB to exhibit full cytotoxicity in the absence of CD11b. Crosslinking, electron microscopy, and hydroxyl radical protein footprinting were used to determine that these mutations caused an increase in the solvent accessibility of the stem domain, priming LukAB for oligomerization.

To assess whether oxytocin receptor (OXTR) signaling might influence this gestational delay, heterozygous (OXTR+\/\u2212) dams which retain sufficient OXTR function for apparently normal parturition and nursing, were bred. After the second breeding, these animals were found to experience a prolonged gestational delay and fewer OXTR knockout (KO) pups were born in litters that experienced diapause. The investigators also observed the effect of temporal patterns of oxytocin release and patterned optogenetic stimulation on the induction of diapause. To examine examining embryonic oxytocin receptor expression in blastocysts, nondiapaused blastocysts were harvested at E3.5 and probed for the presence of OXTRs. In vitro, oxytocin-treated blastocysts were found to exhibit diapause-like delayed implantation. Embryonic survival following ovariectomy-induced diapause was mediated by OXTR signaling; OXTR KO embryos had lower survival rates after diapause induction compared to wild-type embryos.","access_instructions":"All data needed to evaluate the conclusions in the paper are present in the paper on PubMed Central (PMC) under Supplementary Materials.

First, a structure-activity relationship study was performed to improve multivalent peptoid conjugate potency. Then, the impact of MPC309 on AR-mediated gene expression, AR occupancy, chromatin accessibility, and AR\u2019s interaction with coregulatory proteins was examined.

First aggressive behaviors were characterized in short-term and long-term winners and then synaptic and cellular changes in the VMHvl were investigated over repeated winning. Repeated resident-intruder (RI) tests were used to provide winning experiences to the test mice. During the test, a non-aggressive group-housed male mouse was introduced into the home cage of a single-housed male mouse for 10 minutes. If the resident male attacked the intruder and the intruder showed flight and submissive postures, the resident mouse was considered aggressive and won. If the resident mouse investigated the intruder but did not attack during the 10 minutes, the resident was considered non-aggressive and underwent social interaction. Only animals that consistently attacked and won across days were included in the final analysis.

MWCCS integrates two longstanding, longitudinal studies: the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) and the Women\u2019s Interagency HIV Study (WIHS). The MACS began in 1984 as a longitudinal study of HIV-1 infection among gay and bisexual men in the United States and has enrolled more than 7,300 study participants at four clinical research sites, who were evaluated every six months; visit protocols included in-depth interviews, physical examinations, and collection of biological specimens for testing and repository storage. The WIHS began in 1993 as a multicenter longitudinal study to investigate the progression of HIV disease in women and has enrolled nearly 5,000 women (including HIV-positive women and a demographically similar group of HIV-negative women) at six clinical research sites. MACS and WIHS combined to form MWCCS in 2019. <\/p>\r\n<p>Today, the MWCCS includes more than 4,000 active participants both with and without HIV and continues to recruit new participants, with study locations in Alabama, California, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington, DC. The effort will study high-priority research on HIV outcomes, including prevalence, pathology, etiology, mechanisms, treatment, and prevention of morbidity and mortality related to HIV, its treatment, and the intersection of HIV and aging and the contextual factors common in the lives of those with HIV.

It was launched in 2011 as a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); data collection began in 2013 and is planned through 2024. Participants were recruited by a stratified address-based, area-probability sampling design, oversampling adult tobacco users, young adults (18\u201324 years), and African American adults. For the baseline wave (Wave 1), the study sampled over 150,000 mailing addresses across the United States to create the national sample of tobacco users and non-users. At Waves 4 and 7, probability samples were recruited from residential addresses not selected during previous waves in the same sampled Primary Sampling Units (PSUs) and segments using similar within-household procedures; these \"replenishment samples\" were combined for estimation and purposes with adult and youth respondents from their respective waves. <\/p>\r\n<p>Each case in an Adult data file represents a single, completed interview. Each case in a Youth data file represents one youth and his or her parent's responses about that youth. When multiple youth from the same household were selected to be in the study, the parent(s) completed separate interviews about each youth. Youth who turn 18 by the current wave of data collection are considered \"aged-up adults\" and are invited to complete the Adult Interview. Respondents are asked to complete an interview at each follow-up wave.  Additionally, \"shadow youth\" (youth ages 9 to 11 sampled at Wave 1) are considered \"aged-up youth\" upon turning 12 years old, when they are asked to complete an interview after parental consent. Adult interviews covered use of tobacco and nicotine products, peer and family opinions of tobacco use, health and quality of life outcomes, and tobacco product advertising. Youth interviews also included questions about media use and use of other substances; parents were asked about their youth's home and school life as well as their own use of tobacco products. <\/p>\r\n<p>Questions about the collection, content, weighting, documentation, or structure of PATH Study data may be submitted to PATHDataUserQuestions@Westat.com.

It is commonly assumed that S. pneumoniae strains of the same serotype produce capsules of consistent size, despite the organism\u2019s heterogeneity. This study challenged this assumption by analyzing clinical isolates of the same serotype. Two methods were modified to analyze the S. pneumoniae capsule: immunoblot quantification of capsular polysaccharide in bacterial lysates and light microscopy to assess capsule thickness.

Two forms of plasticity are thought to enable neurons to integrate recent activity changes without veering into extreme hypoactivity or hyperactivity. This includes Hebbian positive feedback to strengthen active synapses, long-term potentiation(LTP), and diminish less active ones, long-term depression (LTD), and homeostatic negative feedback to maintain functional stability. It is widely believed that synaptic scaling is a slow first-order process that regulates postsynaptic glutamate receptors and fundamentally differs from LTP or LTD. This study found that the dynamics of scaling induced by neuronal inactivity are not exponential or monotonic, and the mechanism requires calcineurin and CaMKII, molecules dominant in LTD and LTP. Using experimental and computational approaches, they described how synapses use Hebbian and homeostatic elements to adapt to changing activity levels while retaining the capacity for plasticity.

Unique to Dop near its active site is a disordered loop of approximately 40 amino acids that is highly conserved among diverse dop-containing bacterial genera. Therefore, this study deleted discrete sequences from the Dop loop and assessed pupylation in mutant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to understand the function of this domain.
